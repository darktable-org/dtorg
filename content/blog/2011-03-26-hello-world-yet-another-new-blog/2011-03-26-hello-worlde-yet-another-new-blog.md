“Why does darktable need a blog?” you might ask. The answer is quite simple: While we do have a mailing list (actually there are three) which is quite active, most decisions and background informations happen in IRC (#darktable on FreeNode). This is great for fast communications, but it doesn’t allow interested users to follow what we actually (want to) do.

I hope that this blog will be an annotated commit log on the one hand showing the progress we make and a persistent archive of important decisions taken by us on the other hand.
