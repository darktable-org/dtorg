As some of you might have [noticed](http://prokoudine.info/blog/2011/03/darktable-in-gsoc2011/), darktable got accepted for this year’s [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011) (warning, site doesn’t work with every browser …). Currently we are seeing a few possible students lurking around in IRC, preparing their proposals in our [Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/darktable/wiki/GSOC) and getting familiar with the program, code and community. If everything keeps going so smoothly this will be just f****ing awesome. If not we still have the excuse that it’s our first time, so we didn’t know what we were doing.

I guess the hardest part will be the decision which students to take since we have only two mentors (hanatos and houz).
