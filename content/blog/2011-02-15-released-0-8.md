we released version 0.8, which obsoletes 0.7.1 in a lot of ways:



	
  * _much_ faster image loading due to _rawspeed_, an awesome new library by klaus post @rawstudio

	
  * lots of performance improvements in our caches and pixel pipelines (together with the above like 5x--10x)

	
  * gpu computing using opencl (for graphics boards that support it) for a lot of common modules, to give a huge performance boost

	
  * overhauled collection module for more flexible image collections

	
  * metadata editor (set author and copyright information etc)

	
  * fast demosaicing now done on roi and in floating point

	
  * HDR bracketing and tone mapping (somewhat experimental)

	
  * flickr upload

	
  * new languages: thai and japanese

	
  * lots of new color matrices and white balance presets

	
  * lots of bugfixes
