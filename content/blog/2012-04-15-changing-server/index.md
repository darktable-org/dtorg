We are about to move our website to a new server. This will give us a performance boost (e.g. in terms of page loading speed) and might give us the chance to provide some more services in the future.

Due to this the comments are closed as of now until everything is in place again. We hope everything runs smoothly&nbsp;â€“ if not, be patient. :)

...&nbsp;and I take this as an opportunity to thank PolarFox again for hosting darktable's website and taking care of all technical server stuff!


regards,
Simon

[update]

As you may have encountered: we finally moved everything in place and fine-tuned it a bit. So now you should get these pages with almost light speed. Enjoy!
