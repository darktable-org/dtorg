* the changes on top of rc1 are minor, some details:
* fixed a spurious crash/deadlock when switching images in filmstrip mode
* fixed a couple of exif strings for profiled denoising
* fixed gcc 4.8.0 build
* new noise profiles
* fixed gphoto 2.5 issues
* updated translations
* updated user manual!

thanks all, and enjoy the release!
