There are still bug fixes coming, which is good. But nevertheless we just released a release candidate tarball, available for download from here:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.0/darktable-1.0~rc1.tar.gz/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.0/darktable-1.0~rc1.tar.gz/download)

which will hopefully help us to get rid of the last couple of remaining bugs before 1.0. For install instructions have a look on [how to compile from source](/install/#current-release-from-source).

* web gallery export now with next/prev buttons per image
* refactored modules:

    * snapshots (enable sliding separation line between before/after images)
    * metadata

In case you didn't notice yet, there is now also a quite active blog with some insights in ongoing development and new modules, [you might want to check it out](/blog/).

We've updated the about dialog and the manpage with a new author list including the period release-0.9.3..master, but please double check if we forgot someone ...

Thanks all for being a great community, thanks to all contributors! We know how hard it is to spare a few minutes each week to make dt great!
