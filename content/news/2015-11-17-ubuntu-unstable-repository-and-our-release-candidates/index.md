Following is a public service announcement from Pascal de Bruijn, the maintainer of the Ubuntu PPAs.

As most of you know, my [darktable-unstable](https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/ubuntu/darktable-unstable) [PPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive) was serving as a pre-release repository for our stable maintenance tree, as it usually does. Now as master has settled down, and we're slowly gearing up for a 2.0 release, I'll do pre-release (release candidate) builds for darktable 2.0 there.

On my [darktable-unstable](https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/ubuntu/darktable-unstable) [PPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive) I will support Ubuntu Trusty (14.04, the latest [Long Term Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS) release) as always. Temporarily I'll support Ubuntu Wily (15.10, the latest plain release) as well, at least until we have a final 2.0 stable release. Once we have a final 2.0 stable release I will support all Ubuntu versions (still) supported by Canonical at that time via my [darktable-release](https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/ubuntu/darktable-release) [PPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive) as usual.

In general updates on my [darktable-unstable](https://launchpad.net/~pmjdebruijn/+archive/ubuntu/darktable-unstable) [PPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive) should be expected to be fairly erratic, completely depending on the number and significance of changes being made in [git master](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/commits/master). That said, I expect that it will probably average out at once a week or so.

If you find any issues with these darktable release candidates please do report them to our [bug tracker](https://redmine.darktable.org/issues).
