we released version 0.7.1, a small bugfix release to fix up some nuisances in 0.7:

* some more white balance presets
* layout fixes for overlong profile names
* styles now actually work
* extensive documentation in form of [screencasts](https://encrypted.pcode.nl/blog/2010/12/06/darktable-0-7-screencast-library/)

enjoy the release, but be aware that you'll be missing out on a lot of significant speed improvements and cool new features when using the release instead of git :)
