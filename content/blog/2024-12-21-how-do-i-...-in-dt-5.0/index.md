Users new to darktable who have experience with other raw developers
may have trouble figuring out how to do various tasks as a result of
different names or workflows in darktable compared to their previous
software.  The following entries are a quick reference to help you
accomplish what you want to do.

Have a tip not covered here?  Share it in the comments!

### How do I...

<details><summary>run darktable in "simple" or "beginner" mode</summary>

The large number of processing modules and many different ways of
accomplishing the same goal often leaves first-time users feeling
overwhelmed.  You can manage this feeling by *not* trying to use every
single option right from the beginning, but focusing on a few key
controls and slowly learning the rest as you discover that you need
them.

The [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel.md)
contains the most-used sliders and controls other than cropping, so a
suggested strategy to ease yourself into darktable is to limit
yourself to the QAP and the cropping module while editing until you
feel comfortable with them, then gradually explore other modules
(many of which are rather specialized) and additional controls from
the modules on the QAP which are not displayed in the panel.

</details>

<details><summary>remove all the automatically-applied edits</summary>

Most of the automatically-applied edits you see in the
[_darkroom_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom.md) view when opening an image are required
to display your raw file _at all_.  Other software applies equivalent
edits, but doesn't tell you about it.

Operations shown with a dot-inside-a-circle can not be turned off,
because without them there is no image (a raw file is just a pile of
sensor readings).

Others which show with the usual power-button icon can be turned off,
but are needed to have a _useful_ image display.  Automatic addition
of the _color calibration_ and _filmic rgb_ or _sigmoid_ modules can
be disabled by adjusting the auto-applied workflow defaults in the
[_processing_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/processing.md) tab of the
_global preferences_ dialog.

</details>

<details><summary>undo edits or other changes</summary>

Most actions done in [lightable view](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/lighttable/undo-redo.md) can
be reversed with the standard Ctrl-Z shortcut key and reapplied with
Ctrl-Y.

In darkroom view, you can either use
[Ctrl-Z](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/undo-redo.md) to undo actions one step
at a time, or you can click on an item in the
[_history stack_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/history-stack.md)
module to reset the edit state to what it was when that item was added to
the stack.  You can freely jump between different positions in the
history as long as you do not change settings in any of the
[processing modules](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/_index.md).

</details>

<details><summary>make images look like out-of-camera JPEGs</summary>

By default, darktable displays your raw images with minimal processing -
just enough to get a displayable image (for unedited images, the
lighttable thumbnail can be the embedded preview JPEG generated by the
camera using the manufacturer's own algorithms).

As of version 5.0, darktable ships with custom styles to make images
from most supported camera models look more like the camera
manufacturer's processing.  You can apply these manually or
automatically on import.

For automatic application, install and activate the
`apply_camera_style` Lua script in the [script
installer](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/lua-scripts-installer.md).
You can also use this script to apply the appropriate style to a
selection of images which have already been imported.

For manual application, open the
[_styles_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles.md)
module and navigate to the `darktable camera styles` entry in the list
of styles.  Expand this entry to show camera manufacturers, then
expand the appropriate manufacturer to access its models.  Note that
applying a different model's style to your camera's images is unlikely
to make them look like JPEGs from the other model, but may still yield
interesting results.
</details>

<details><summary>batch edit photos</summary>

To apply the same edit to multiple photos, you can

- use a [style](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles.md)

- edit one photo and then [copy and paste](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/history-stack.md)
  the edits onto others

See also the [tutorial](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/guides-tutorials/batch-editing.md).

</details>

<details><summary>make a virtual copy of an image</summary>

darktable calls multiple developments of a single image "duplicates".  You
can create, remove, or name them using the
_duplicate manager_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/duplicate-manager.md)
in [_darkroom_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/darkroom-view-layout.md) view, and you can
create duplicates by selecting one or more images in the lighttable
and clicking on the _duplicate_ button in the
[_actions on selection_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/selected-image.md)
module.

</details>

<details><summary>make adjustment layers</summary>

The darktable [pixelpipe](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/the-pixelpipe-and-module-order.md) is effectively equivalent to a stack of
adjustment layers, and the right-hand active modules display can be
treated very much like a Layers window/pane in pixel editors.  You
start with a base image at the bottom, and then each successive module
takes its input from below, makes some modification (if enabled), and
passes the result to the module above it - just like in a Layers tool,
where making a particular layer invisible is just turning off its
effects.  As with adjustment layers, [reordering](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/module-order.md) modules will
change the overall effect of the processing.

By enabling a module, or by [duplicating](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/multiple-instances.md) one, you have just added
an adjustment layer to your processing.  Just like layers, (almost)
any processing module in darktable can be [masked](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/_index.md).

</details>

<details><summary>add clarity</summary>

What other programs call clarity is an adjustment of local contrast.
You can do this in darktable with the
[_local contrast_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/local-contrast.md)
module (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel.md)
by default) or by starting with the "clarity" preset in the
[_contrast equalizer_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer.md)
module (quite strong) or one of the "local contrast" presets in the
[_diffuse and sharpen_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/diffuse.md)
module (generally very subtle).

</details>

<details><summary>adjust hue/saturation/lightness (HSL)</summary>

To adjust the hue, saturation, and/or lightness of pixels based on
their original colors, use the
[_color equalizer_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-equalizer.md)
module.

To adjust the hue, saturation, and/or lightness of pixels based on
their saturation or lightness, use the
[_color zones_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-zones.md)
module.

</details>

<details><summary>adjust contrast/brightness/saturation</summary>

To adjust contrast, you can use

- the contrast slider in either [_filmic rgb_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/filmic-rgb.md)
  (on the _look_ tab) or [_sigmoid_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/sigmoid.md)
  (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel.md)
  by default when workflow is set to either of the "scene-referred" options in preferences).

- the contrast slider in [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb.md),
  adjusting the _contrast gray fulcrum_ slider on the _masks_ tab to control the center point of the contrast.

- the [_contrast equalizer_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer.md)
  module for more localized contrast.

- the [_local contrast_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/local-contrast.md)
  module for very localized contrast enhancement, also known as
  "clarity" (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel.md)
  by default).

To adjust brightness, you can use

- the [_exposure_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/exposure.md) module for linear adjustment

- the _brilliance grading_ sliders in
  [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb.md)
  for perceptual brightness adjustments (the "global brilliance" slider is
  on the Quick Access Panel by default).

To adjust saturation, you can use

- the _global vibrance_, _chroma grading_, or _saturation grading_ sliders in
  [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb.md)
  (on the Quick Access Panel by default).

- the [_velvia_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-module/velvia.md) module

</details>

<details><summary>adjust shadows/highlights</summary>

To open shadows or improve details in highlights, use the
[_tone equalizer_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/tone-equalizer.md).

On its _masking_ tab, click the two magic wands, and fine-tune the
mask brightness with the _mask exposure compensation_ and _mask
contrast compensation_ sliders.  Then move your mouse over areas of
the image you want to adjust and scroll to brighten or darken areas of
the image with that brightness.

</details>

<details><summary>make a luminosity mask</summary>

Since a luminosity masks adjusts the strength of an effect by the
brightness of each pixel, you can accomplish this by creating a
[_parametric mask_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric.md)
for the effect and adjusting the "g" (gray) or L/Jz channel controls.
For a mask targeting highlights, move the upper left triangle all the
way to the right; for a mask targeting shadows, move the upper right
triangle all the way to the left.  A midtone mask can be created by
moving both upper triangles to the middle; to match other software,
you may need to reduce the _opacity_ slider to around 50%.  The gray
channel will provide a scene-linear ramp, while the L and Jz channels
produce a perceptually linear ramp.

</details>

<details><summary>add text to an image</summary>

Use the [_watermark_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/watermark.md)
module with one of the text markers, i.e. "simple-text",
"simple-text-shadow", or "fixed-size-text".

You can add multi-line text with a single instance of the module by
inserting "$(NL)" where the text should wrap to the next line.  Other
[variables](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/special-topics/variables.md) can also be inserted and
will be replaced by their current values whenever the image is
processed.

</details>

<details><summary>combine multiple images</summary>

To combine multiple images, such as creating a mosaic or inserting
additional content into an image (such as [replacing the
sky](sky-replacement.md):

- ensure that all images you want to combine have been
  [imported](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import.md)
  into your library

- use [_canvas enlargement_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/enlarge-canvas.md)
  on one image (the "base" image) to add more space for the other images, if needed

- use the
  [_composite_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite.md)
  module and drag the second image from the filmstrip into the module.
  Adjust the position, size, and rotation as desired.  Use a mask to
  include only part of the overlaid image.

- if you want to combine more than two images, create additional
  instances of the _composite_ module, one per image

An [example style]() (download and import into darktable from the
[styles](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles.md) module)
shows the use of _canvas enlargement_ and _composite_ to make a 2x2
grid of images plus caption text suitable for printing borderless on
US Letter (8.5x11") paper.

</details>

<details><summary>replace the sky in an image</summary>

To replace the sky in an image, you will first need another picture of
just sky with the appearance you like.  Ensure that the image has been
[imported](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import.md)
into your library.

On the image whose sky you want to replace, open the
[_composite_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite.md)
module and drag your sky image from the filmstrip into the module.

Turn on [parametric](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric.md)
or [drawn and parametric](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn-and-parametric.md)
masking, then use color and lightness to select the sky and optionally
a drawn mask to exclude any areas which can't be excluded without
losing a portion of the sky.

</details>

<details><summary>make an image black&white/monochrome</summary>

See the tutorial [_developing monochrome images_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/guides-tutorial/monochrome.md).

You can use the [_color calibration_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-calibration.md),
[_color balance rgb_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb.md),
or [_monochrome_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/monochrome.md)
modules to desaturate a color image to shades of gray.

</details>

<details><summary>apply a radial gradient</summary>

darktable does not have radial gradients, but you can get a very similar effect by
[_masking_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn.md)
with a circle or ellipse which you adjust to a very small size with a
very large feather to get a gradual drop-off in intensity in all
directions from a central point.

It is also possible to curve a gradient mask, but this is more
appropriate for matching a curved line in the image than for emulating
a point source for an effect.

</details>

<details><summary>remove an object from an image</summary>

darktable does not provide any AI-based object removal or inpainting
methods, but you can replace an area in your image using either the
[_retouch_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/retouch.md)
or [_composite_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite.md)
modules.  With _retouch_, you can replace the area with content from
elsewhere in the same image using the "heal" or "clone" modes, while
_composite_ lets you insert an arbitrary image from your library.

</details>

<details><summary>unsqueeze an anamorphic image</summary>

Images taken with an anamorphic lens will have a different pixel
aspect ratio than the scene which was photographed.  To restore the
correct appearance, use the
_scale pixels_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/scale-pixels.md)
module.

</details>

<details><summary>create a "smart collection"</summary>

Every [_collection_](https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/collections.md)
in darktable is "smart", and will immediately update when an image's
metadata changes such that it is newly included in or excluded from
the collection's search criteria.
