for more information on how to contribute._

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.6. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- Editing history is now periodically auto-saved (every 10 seconds)
  while editing images in the darkroom view. The auto-save interval can
  be changed (via a preference) or auto-save can be disabled entirely
  (by setting the interval to 0).

- A new processing module _rgb primaries_ has been added. This module can be used
  for delicate color corrections as well as creative color grading.
  It allows the red, green and blue primary colors to be moved around
  using "hue" and "purity" controls.

  The underlying pixel operation is essentially the same as channel mixing.

- In addition, the _sigmoid_ module now includes a new _primaries_ section,
  which can be used to gracefully handle difficult lighting situations
  (e.g. LEDs) and tune the overall look of the image. Modifying these
  parameters can provide pleasing sunsets, improved skin tones etc.
  This feature can only be used with sigmoid's per-channel mode and is
  loosely based on ideas from Troy Sobotka's [AgX](https://github.com/sobotka/AgX-S2O3)
  and related work in the [Blender community](https://blenderartists.org/t/feedback-development-filmic-baby-step-to-a-v2/1361663).
  The included "smooth" preset should provide a good starting point
  for further corrections using this feature.

- When working with the liquify and retouch modules, the full uncropped
  image is now always shown, with any crop indicated by displaying an overlaid
  rectangle. This allows for cropped-out parts of the image to be used without
  having to first disable the crop module and re-enable it when finished.

- When panning or zooming in the darkroom view, a low resolution placeholder
  used to be shown until the image was fully recalculated for the newly-visible
  region. Now, if any part of the previous view is still visible, that part will
  be immediately shown in high quality, with only the remainder of the image
  being temporarily shown in low quality until the pipe has finished.

  This has been achieved as part of a complete reworking of the darkroom image
  display, which has also removed some annoying jumps when
  replacing the low resolution placeholder with recalculated image data,
  or when switching between full and cropped view
  (when the crop, retouch or liquify modules are (un)focused).

## Performance Improvements

- OpenCL is now initialized in the background immediately after launching
  the darktable UI, with progress indicated by a series of toast messages.
  Previously, this was done before the main UI was launched, which
  could lead to significant delays (sometimes more than a minute) between
  the user opening darktable and anything appearing on-screen, making
  it appear as though darktable had failed to start. Note that processing
  will be slower (since darktable will only use the CPU) until OpenCL is fully
  initialized.

- An OpenCL code path has been implemented for lens correction using embedded
  correction metadata.

- Image display speed in the map view has been increased by 25%.

- Export speed has been improved for JPEG 2000 and B&W TIFF images.

- The chromatic aberrations module is now approximately 10% faster when
  run on the CPU.

## Other Changes

- The hot pixels module now supports monochrome images.

- The internal compositional guide widget has been removed from the retouch
  module as it is not required (you can still display the guide globally).

- A long-running import session can now be canceled by clicking on the cross
  in the progress bar on the bottom left of the screen.

- Auto orientation is now supported when importing AVIF/HEIF images
  (requires at least libavif 0.9.2 and/or libheif 1.16.0).

- It is now possible to visualize raster masks in the same way as other
  mask types by clicking the mask visualization icon.

- The dual demosaic mask visualization and performance have been improved.

- It is now possible to manually define additional vignette correction via
  the lens correction module.

- The linear ProPhoto RGB color space can now be selected in the LUT 3D module.

- The following changes have been made to the OpenCL implementation:

  - Benchmarking code has been removed as it no longer produces valid
    results on today's computers.

  - The "pinned memory transfer" option has now been removed from the
    preferences dialog, though it can still be set on a per-device basis.

  - A new option "use all device memory" has been added to the preferences
    dialog. Select this option to use all GPU memory, with the exception
    of a 600MB "headroom" which is left free for use by other applications.
    A similar option was previously available in earlier versions of darktable,
    however the headroom is now increased to 600MB to account for greater
    use of GPU acceleration on modern systems.

  - A new set of options have been added to the preferences dialog, to allow
    selection of desired OpenCL drivers.

- A built-in "Display P3" color profile has been added for use in input,
  output, display, working and soft-proofing profiles.

- The highlight reconstruction module can now be used for all non-raw files.

- The scroll speed in the filmstrip can now be increased by
  holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while scrolling (filmstrip will move by half
  of the visible images at a time). Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while scrolling
  changes the number of images shown (zooms the filmstrip) and thereby also
  changes the speed achieved when holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>.

- Exported PNG files now embed a CICP (Coding-Independent Code
  Points) encoded color profile in addition to ICC where possible.

- Exported AVIF files now no longer embed a superfluous ICC profile if the
  color profile can be encoded as CICP.

- Improved scaling and placement of images in the culling view now make
  better use of available screen space.

- When hovering over the sample patches in the global color picker module
  those areas are displayed on the central image and on the histogram (if
  the corresponding option is selected). It is no longer necessary
  to have the color-picker activated when doing this. This enhanced behavior
  is useful, for example, when color grading.

- It is now possible to display a tooltip for a slider or drop-down
  and a separate tooltip for the button to its right (commonly a
  color picker button). This was not possible in previous versions
  of darktable, and was an issue where the button was not directly
  linked to the slider (for example, a button for mask display).

- Holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while double clicking a slider or
  drop-down in a processing module now restores any auto-applied
  preset.

- Where multiple drawn shapes are grouped (e.g. in a module's mask)
  the mask manager module now displays a tick mark in front of the
  active combination mode (in the popup menu) when right-clicking one of
  the constituent shapes. This is usually much easier to read than the
  "Venn diagram" icons in the main module UI.

- Mnemonics have been added to dialog boxes and default actions have been
  assigned, so that pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will trigger the correct
  action and close the dialog.

- More OpenEXR 3.2.0 attributes can now be extracted and displayed in
  the image information module, where present.

- Lens and cameras filters have been added to the collection filters module.

- AVIF exports have been changed so that there is now no conversion to YUV
  for lossless. The quantizer selection logic has been updated and
  "lossy" is now the default.

- The content of the main preferences dialog is now (almost) entirely taken
  from a single definition file (`darktableconfig.xml.in`) making its layout
  much easier to modify.

- The drop-downs in the preferences dialog now use the same (bauhaus)
  widgets as the drop-downs in the rest of the application, offering
  a more consistent behavior.

- The configuration system now has improved number precision.

- The collections module has been reworked for more consistent sorting.
  All date/time sort orders can now be reversed
  (placing either the oldest or newest first).
  The film roll order can also be reversed when ordered by
  id (which is equivalent to the film roll's first import date).
  The "sort film rolls by" preference has been renamed from "id"
  to "import time" to make this clearer.

  The collection filtering based on rating now uses proper text
  (like "rejected" instead of -1) and the numbers are replaced by stars.

  The collection module now displays color labels in the same order
  as in the rest of the UI.

- Adding a tag to an image is now considered to be an "edit" and causes
  XMP sidecars to be created/updated (unless XMP creation is disabled).

- New functionality has been added to automatically generate thumbnails
  in the background while the user is inactive in the lighttable view.
  Currently this functionality is only available by running
  `darktable-generate-cache` from the command-line. The new functionality
  is controlled via a preference setting that defines which thumbnail
  sizes to generate in the background (default "never").

- Two new variables have been introduced to allow the camera crop factor
  ("EXIF.CROP\_FACTOR") and 35mm-equivalent focal length
  ("EXIF.FOCAL.LENGTH.EQUIV") to be displayed.

- Color harmony guides in the scopes module are now saved and restored
  for every image. It is therefore no longer necessary to reset the
  guides when going back to a previous edit. This information is also
  stored in the XMP file so can be viewed when sharing edits or
  re-importing a collection.

- It is now possible to control chroma subsampling in JPEG exports.

  This allows the user to reduce the color resolution, often resulting in
  much smaller files that are virtually indistinguishable
  from images with more color information.

  On the other hand, certain images will look better when the chroma
  resolution is maximized. This includes images with small colored details
  surrounded by a solid background (such as screenshots with colored text).

- The option to ignore JPEG files when importing is now outdated,
  given that many cameras can also output HEIF images. This option has
  therefore now been changed to ignore all non-raw files.

- The lens correction module now supports embedded metadata from Olympus
  .ORF files for correction of distortion and chromatic aberration.

  This correction is equivalent to that applied by the camera body to
  in-camera JPEGs. For older bodies that do not apply chromatic
  aberration correction to the JPEGs, the required information is
  also excluded from the embedded metadata so darktable will be unable
  to apply corrections.

  Vignetting correction based on embedded metadata is not supported.
  However, if the camera's "Shading Compensation" option is enabled, the
  vignetting correction will already have been applied to the data in the raw
  file.

- The shortcuts system has received several refinements:

  - Deleting or overwriting a default shortcut now moves it to the
    "disabled defaults" category from where it can restored by
    pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd>. It is no longer necessary to uncheck
    "load default shortcuts at startup" (in prefs/misc/interface) to
    keep it disabled.

  - Visual mapping mode now has improved mouse cursors to indicate whether
    the widget under the cursor can have a shortcut assigned or be added
    to (or removed from) the quick access panel.

  - The shortcuts tab in the preferences dialog now explains that it may
    be more convenient to use visual mapping mode.

  - When combining a shortcut with a mouse move (for example
    <kbd>b+scroll</kbd>), separate actions can be triggered by up and
    down moves. For example, <kbd>b+scroll-up</kbd> could cycle
    through the top panel options and <kbd>b+scroll-down</kbd>
    through the bottom panel combinations.

  - A problem with drop-down and slider popups opened via a shortcut,
    whereby they would immediately fill with the shortcut key
    character, was resolved. Those popups are now integrated into the shortcut
    system, so most non-alphanumeric shortcuts will continue to work. If a
    dropdown value is changed while the popup is open (for example via
    an automatic calculation in color calibration, a Lua script or a
    MIDI shortcut), the popup is correctly updated/repositioned. After
    a popup is closed it can quickly be reopened to enter another
    value by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> (as long as the corresponding
    widget still has focus).

  - On macOS the system shortcuts e.g. for copy and paste will now work
    according to the macOS keyboard defaults, meaning using the <kbd>command</kbd>
    key instead of the original Linux style <kbd>control</kbd> key.

- The ISO 12464 color assessment mode for the secondary
  preview window is now activated independently from the main window
  (and saved between sessions) with a toggle in the
  <kbd>right-click</kbd> popover of the "display second window" button
  (or using the default <kbd>alt+b</kbd> shortcut).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with the OpenCL platform checks that were causing freezes.

- Fixed the size calculation of resizable widgets based on line size of
  their contents.

- Fixed a bug in the collection filters module where the conjunction of
  multiple filters was not handled properly.

- Fixed focus distance detection for Nikon Z mount lens corrections.

- Fixed incorrect cropping of sensor data for sRaw dng files.

- Apply the Lightroom color matrix only when importing a genuine
  Lightroom XMP sidecar file.

- Fixed a crash when increasing the number of recent collections.

- Fixed a crash when clicking+dragging the feather line on the path
  mask.

- Fixed a crash when applying the CMYK soft-proof ICC profile.

- The white borders for ISO 12464 color assessment (toggled with
  <kbd>Ctrl+b</kbd>) are now correctly sized and placed at all
  zoom levels and no longer flash when switching between low and high
  quality preview, both in the center view and secondary preview
  window.

- Fixed an issue downloading to Piwigo when the "on conflict" option
  was set to "don't check".

- Fixed several mouse scroll-wheel issues on macOS when used in
  combination with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier key (color harmonies
  width, module height, geotagging date/time, ...).

- When loading an XMP sidecar file from disk, resolved an issue where the
  assigned "duplicate number" was already present in the database. This
  has been resolved by instead recalculating the "duplicate number" at import
  time for all duplicates.

- For large collections on the lighttable and when using small
  thumbnails (more than 15 per line), using the scrollbar or scrolling
  the mouse to move up/down could be slow. The responsiveness of the
  lighttable in this scenario has now been drastically improved and is
  fast and responsive even with ~50k images and 20 thumbnails per line.

- Fixed pixel errors in RAW Chromatic Aberration and LMMSE demosaic
  resulting in decreased noise.

- Fixed the 'avoid colorshift' mode in the RAW Chromatic Aberrations
  module.

- Fixed the snapshot module so that snapshots for removed images
  are no longer accessible – this was previously causing crashes
  when attempting to display a snapshot of a removed image.

- Fixed a potential crash when using an unsupported ICC profile for
  soft-proofing.

- Fixed multiple issues when computing borders in the framing module.
  For a 0% border on the bottom or right-hand side a single pixel
  border was sometimes shown, depending on the export size/zoom level.

  Note that a 0% border doesn't necessarily mean no border at all
  if the chosen aspect ratio doesn't correspond to the aspect ratio
  of the image.

- The internal luminance mask in the tone equalizer has been
  made more resilient to distortion changes made with modules like lens
  correction, crop, etc. After activating a crop, the tone equalizer
  cursor will now show the proper mask luminance values when hovering
  over the image in the darkroom.

- Fixed calculation of required graphics memory for modules performing
  blending operations, possibly avoiding crashes related to OpenCL.

- Added the ability to calculate the crop factor for those cameras
  that do not include this information in their Exif metadata.

- Fixed various bugs related to feathering masks.

- Fixed a DPI scaling issue on macOS causing some GUI elements being
  rendered too small.

## Lua

### API Version

- API version is now 9.2.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `scripts_installer` to handle user names with spaces on Windows.

### Add action support for Lua


### Other Lua changes

- Allow access to image `change_timestamp`.

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export module's preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be achieved by removing line 241 of the
  `darktable.css` file on your system. See
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166.

- Starting with release 4.4 a new support policy regarding macOS
  versions has been put in place – darktable releases will now only
  support those macOS versions that are also supported by Apple.
  Release 4.6 therefore drops support for macOS versions older than
  12.5.
