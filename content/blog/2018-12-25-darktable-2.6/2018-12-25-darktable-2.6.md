TODO: intro.

Among the new major features:

* A new *retouch* module, similar to the *spot removal* module with
  smart cloning ("heal") and ability to act on each level of detail
  individually.

* A new *filmic* module, able to manage most aspects of the tone of an
  image in a single module.

* A complete rework of the *color balance* module, which can now be
  seen as a color-aware variant of *levels*, and can do most
  adjustments automatically thanks to new color picker buttons.

* The ability to guide the blurring of the blend mask, to select an
  object precisely with minimal effort.

# Major features

<span id="retouch" />
## A new module: *retouch*

While darktable is primarily focused on raw development, recent
versions introduced features like *liquify*, traditionally available
only in pixel-oriented editors like GIMP. One more important step in
this direction is done with the new *retouch* module, which
essentially supersedes *spot removal*, together with
frequency-splitting editing for fine retouch.

### Improvements compared to spot removal

The interface has a lot more buttons than *spot removal*, but
everything you could do with the later is also possible in a similar
way with retouch.

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch module overview]({filename}rt-overview.png)
  </div>

Just like with *spot removal*, you may select a shape (circle,
ellipse, path, or brush, which wasn't available with *spot removal*) and
click on a part of the image you want to hide. The module will clone
another part of the image to hide it. Drag instead of clicking to
choose the source of the clone, or adjust the controls after the fact.

Many details will make your life easier than before:

#### Seamless cloning, better results with less efforts

By default, the clone uses a "seamless cloning" algorithm (borrowed
from GIMP's "heal" tool), which adapts the source to the context
where it is cloned. You don't need to clone *exactly* the right
piece of image. Let's take a common example: a small defect in a
not-completely-uniform sky:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch example]({filename}rt-original.png)
  </div>

A bad attempt to fix this with the clone tool would give:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch clone (with controls)]({filename}rt-clone.png)
  </div>

The piece of sky copied to mask the defect is a bit darker than the
place where it's copied. It's not obvious while the controls are
displayed on the image, but the final image is really bad:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch clone (without controls)]({filename}rt-clone-nocontrol.png)
  </div>

The same retouch with the new "heal" tool
(![heal tool]({filename}rt-heal-icon.png)) gives this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal (with controls)]({filename}rt-heal.png)
  </div>

This time, the final image is indistinguishable from a real sky
without defect:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal (without controls)]({filename}rt-heal-nocontrol.png)
  </div>

Even when cloning pieces of images of totally different colors, the
"heal" tool behaves surprisingly well. Let's push the module a bit:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal on different colors]({filename}rt-heal-red-white-blue.png)
  </div>

The white patch is cloned to the blue shirt, the blue shirt to the red
one, and the red one to the white one. Each time, the local contrast
is kept, but the overall color and luma of the patch is adapted to fit
the destination.

The basic "clone" tool (![clone tool]({filename}rt-clone-icon.png)) is
still available for the rare cases where you would want it.

#### Fill and blur, when you don't have anything to clone

In addition to the "clone" and "heal" tools (which work only when you
have a piece of image to duplicate on the spot to remove), retouch
provides a "fill" tool (![fill tool]({filename}rt-fill-icon.png))
(fill a shape with a color) and a "blur" tool
(![blur tool]({filename}rt-blur-icon.png)) (apply a blur to soften a
part of the image tools). These tools are most useful for
split-frequency editing, see below.

#### One activation, multiple strokes: continuous add

Tools can be activated once for multiple strokes. Just use
Control-click on one of the point, line, ellipse or path tool
(instead of a normal click), and the tool will remain active until
you explicitly deactivate it. This is very convenient when fixing
many spots on the same image, compared to the previous flow where
one had to re-click the tool's button for each stroke.

#### Source patch visualization

For "clone" and "heal" tools, each stroke consists in a source and a
destination. With a simple click, one sets the destination and by
default darktable picks an arbitrary location for the source. One can already
set both source and destination with a simple mouse action by dragging
from destination to source.

Retouch introduces a more advanced mechanism:

* While moving the mouse over the image, the future destination is
  marked with its shape, and the source is marked with a small cross:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Retouch source and destination]({filename}rt-source-cross.png)
  </div>

* To select a source, use Shift-click on the image. The cross is
  placed at the mouse location and won't move until you select the
  destination, with a simple click. This is interesting combined with
  the permanent activation of the tool mentioned above: the source
  for multiple strokes will be located at the same place, relative to
  the destination.

* A variant: use Control-Shift-Click instead of Shift-Click. This also
  sets the source location, but this time it will remain fixed in
  absolute coordinate instead of relative to the destination.

### Split-frequency editing

A common issue with photo retouching, typically for portrait, is that
you want to hide spots, and sometimes reduce local contrast to make
the skin appear softer, but keep the skin's texture. A brutal blur
would make the skin overly soft and will give at best an "obviously
post-processed" look. Let's take this image as an example (taken from
a
[pixls.us PlayRaw contest](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/playraw-hillbilly-portrait/5518):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait]({filename}rt-overall-portrait.jpg)
  </div>

A common technique for this kind of retouching is to split the image
into several images corresponding to different levels of details, and
then combine the images together. This is what [GIMP's
wavelet decompose plugin](https://pixls.us/articles/skin-retouching-with-wavelet-decompose/)
does, for example. After splitting, one gets a blurry image
corresponding to the coarse details, and one or several images
containing details only. In our example, we get:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait]({filename}rt-portrait-scale4.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 5]({filename}rt-portrait-scale5.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 6]({filename}rt-portrait-scale6.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 7]({filename}rt-portrait-scale7.jpg)
  </div>

This kind of transformation is used internally by the *equalizer*
module, which allows you to increase or decrease the importance of
each level of detail in the image. While *equalizer* works globally on
the image, *retouch* allows you to select the level of detail and the
portion of image you want to work with.

In the retouch module, this corresponds to the "wavelet decompose"
part of the GUI:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Wavelet decompose scales]({filename}rt-scales.png)
  </div>

This part shows one rectangle per scale (fine-grained on the left,
coarse-grained on the right). The dark rectangle on the left
corresponds to the full image, and the white one on the right to the
residual image, i.e. the image where all other levels of details have
been removed. By default, darktable always shows the final image, but
you can visualize the details scales and residual image by clicking
the "display wavelet scales
(![Display wavelet scales icon]({filename}rt-display-wavelet-scales.png))
button. The currently selected image appears with a red rectangle.
Move the bottom slider to change the number of details scales to use.
Depending on the zoom level, some details scale may be finer than your
screen resolution, hence unusable. The grey line above the scales
shows which scales are visible at the current zoom level.

When viewing the details scales, contrast may be too weak or too
strong so the module proposes a levels adjustment (which apply only on
the on-screen preview, not on the final image):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Levels adjustment]({filename}rt-levels.png)
  </div>

Each of the tools presented above (heal, clone, fill, blur) is usable
on any of these scales. Think of them as layers obtained from the
source image, and re-combined together after retouching to obtain the
final image. This is where "fill" and "blur" tools make most sense:
"fill" defaults to an erase mode where the fill color is black, which
corresponds to remove the details when used on details scales. One can
also pick a color and fill with this color (most useful on the
residual image scale). Using "blur" directly on the image usually
results in clearly visible post-processing, but using it selectively
on scales results in very subtle effects.

#### Example 1: spot reduction instead of spot removal

Let's focus on the spot below the glasses. If we want to completely
remove it, it's pretty easy to do so with the "heal" tool. Now, what
happens if we decide that we want to keep it, but reduce it to avoid
drawing the attention. We can just remove it from the coarse detail
scale (scale 6 in our example). The spot is no longer visible on the
residual image, so removing it from the details scale is sufficient.
The "heal" tool allows us to do that cleanly, but when dealing with
the details scale, the "fill" and "blur" tools can also give good
results. Here's the result on scale 6 (before on the left, after on
the right):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6]({filename}rt-before-after-scale6.jpg)
  </div>

The final image will be transformed as follows:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6 (final image)]({filename}rt-before-after-final.jpg)
  </div>

Now, we may decide that the healing we did on scale 6 should also be
applied on scale 5. We can redo the same thing manually, but we can
also use the top slider, called "merge scale", to automatically
replicate shapes to multiple scales. Any shape created on the right
hand side of this slider will be replicated on all finer scales up to
the merge slider (except if the slider is completely set to 0, which
means deactivate the merging). By setting the slider to 5, we apply
our healing to both scales 5 and 6, and get the following:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6]({filename}rt-merge-5-6.jpg)
  </div>

If we move the slider further to the left, the spot disappears
progressively. Using the same principle, we can remove marks on the
skin while preserving the hair of the beard:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after, preserving beard]({filename}rt-beard-preserve.jpg)
  </div>

(Just one "heal" shape on scale 7, propagated to scale 5 using the
merge slider)

#### Example 2: playing with the skin's texture

If we want to change the texture of the skin on the cheek, we can
apply a blur on a shape like this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Blur on a detail scale]({filename}rt-blur-detail.jpg)
  </div>

and get the following before/after result:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Changing the skin texture]({filename}rt-skin-texture.jpg)
  </div>

Obviously, this kind of retouching should be done with great care:
when pushed too far, one gets an overly artificial look. When unsure,
you can always get back to your retouch and use blending with an
opacity lower than 100%, or change the opacity or blur radius of each
shape individually.

#### Example 3: having fun with the residual image

Just for fun (do not reproduce at home, ugly images to be expected!),
we can get a tattoo effect by using the clone tool on the residual
image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}rt-clone-residual-image.jpg)
  </div>

While not really elegant, this example illustrates the
"split-frequency" principle: we've kept the fine details from the
cheek, and cloned the coarse ones in the residual image.

<span id="filmic" />
## New module: *filmic*

The filmic module was designed to reproduce the good properties of
analog film, while giving you the easy controls of digital
photography. It can be used on any image as a replacement for the
*base curve* module, and is particularly adapted for images with a
high dynamic range, i.e. a large difference between brightest and
darkest areas.

Let's take an example of such image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Example HDR image]({filename}filmic-example-image.jpg)
  </div>

A common approach to deal with high dynamic range images is to
compress the global contrast while retaining the local one. darktable
has several modules able to do this: *tone mapping*, *global tonemap*,
*shadows and highlights*, and since darktable 2.2 the exposure fusion
mode in the *base curve* module. This contrast compression works to
some extend, but results in artificial look when pushed too far. What
you typically want to avoid is this (using *tone mapping*, contrast
compression set to the maximum):

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Example HDR image]({filename}filmic-hdr-too-much.jpg)
  </div>

The filmic module shows that another approach is possible, and usually
gives more natural results. It considers pixels individually, without
trying to distinguish between local and global contrast. If filmic
compresses the contrast too much, it is still possible to recover
local contrast with the excellent *local contrast* module for example.

*filmic* is meant to be used without the *base curve* module
(activated by default in darktable). The base curve comes very early
in the pipeline and yields a contrasty image where highlights are
often blown out. Recovering details lost by the base curve is
difficult. On the other hand, just disabling the base curve usually
results in fade images, lacking contrast and saturation. Other
contrast enhancement techniques must be used to compensate for this.
filmic comes later than *base curve* in the pipeline, and gives more
control to exploit the dynamic range of the output image properly.

The first thing *filmic* does is to apply a logarithmic curve to the
image, so that the "stops" (factor of two in luminance in a linear
space) are spread evenly on the histogram.

A source of inspiration behind *filmic* is analog film. One difference
between analog film and digital sensors is the way they react to
overexposure. Digital sensors have a clipping threshold above which
everything is considered white: they can't distinguish between pixels
slightly above the threshold and pixels grossly overexpose. Analog
film respond differently: contrast is reduced progressively as the
image is overexposed, without this threshold effect. This allows
analog films to render a scene with a high dynamic range on a medium
with a lower dynamic range, while keeping contrast in the midtones.

Similar effect can be obtained in the digital world by applying an
S-shaped curve to the image, as long as the highlights are not
clipped. With the tone curve module, one can draw a curve like this
one:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Exposure adjustment]({filename}filmic-S-shaped.png)
  </div>

The second thing filmic does is to apply such curve, but instead of
providing the curve manually, the curve is computed automatically from
a set of parameters. This makes it easy to balance shadows, highlights
and midtones.

### Example image

Let's process our image with this module. Before applying filmic, we
first need to disable the *base curve* module, and then to adjust the
exposure. No pixel should be overexposed nor underexposed. In our
case, we need to reduce the exposure to avoid overexposing the sky:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Exposure adjustment]({filename}filmic-exposure.jpg)
  </div>

For the automatic setting to work best, it is also advised to use the
"AMaZE" mode in the *demosaic* module. Activating a noise reduction
module coming before filmic in the pipeline (e.g. *denoise
(profiled)*) may help, too.

### Logarithmic shaper

The first thing displayed in the *filmic* module is an overview of the
curve applied to the image. The curve is not editable directly, the
point of the module being to compute the curve from the sliders below.

To get a good starting point, *filmic* provides an "auto tune level"
picker. By default, it considers the whole image, and sets the three
sliders above based on average luminance, brightest area and darkest
area:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![One click on "auto tune levels"]({filename}filmic-autotune-levels.jpg)
  </div>

The black cursor is often wrong. It is actually not an easy task for
an automatic tool to pick the right black level (it can't take an
absolute black as reference, since absolute black would be mapped to
-infinity in a log scale). One can fix it either by guessing the
dynamic range of the image (on a contrasty enough image, this is the
dynamic range of the camera, i.e. around 14 EV on a high-end camera or
around 10 EV for an average compact camera). The black cursor can be
set to the value of the white one minus the dynamic range.
Alternatively, one can move the cursor to let the histogram fill its
horizontal axis. In our case, we also need to tweak the white cursor
to get the sun completely to the right of the histogram:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Manual adjustment of black and white levels]({filename}filmic-adjust-white-black.jpg)
  </div>

After these settings, the histogram is spread over the dynamic range
of the target image. No pixel are overexposed:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Histogram after adjustment]({filename}filmic-adjust-histogram.png)
  </div>

Now comes the magic: the "middle grey luminance" picker allows us to
chose which part of the image will be considered as middle grey (50%
luminance). For example, if we set it on the cheek of the dog, we get
this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Middle grey on the dog's cheek]({filename}filmic-middle-grey-dog.jpg)
  </div>

If we select the nose of the dog, which is much darker, we get this
brighter image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Middle grey on the dog's nose]({filename}filmic-middle-grey-nose.jpg)
  </div>

On the other hand, if we select a bright area in the sky, the overall
exposure is lowered to get proper exposure on the sky:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Middle grey on the sky]({filename}filmic-middle-grey-sky.jpg)
  </div>

For all these images, the black and white points are kept, no over or
underexposure. In the end, picking the grass behind the dog is
probably the best option here, but it's a matter of taste:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Middle grey on the grass]({filename}filmic-middle-grey-grass.jpg)
  </div>

### S-shaped curve

Let's now move to the second part of the module: the S-shaped curve.
Basically, it will increase the contrast in the midtones (the
"contrast" slider) and compress shadows and/or highlights. You may not
have noticed it, but *filmic* has already been doing so since we
activated it, as the "contrast" slider is set to 1.5 by default. If we
disable the S-shaped curve (setting "contrast" to 1), we get a duller
image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![No contrast in S-shaped curve]({filename}filmic-no-contrast.jpg)
  </div>

On the other hand, we can add more contrast than done by default:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![High contrast in S-shaped curve]({filename}filmic-high-contrast.jpg)
  </div>

Of course, at some point increasing the contrast will result in
loosing information in shadows and/or highlights. The curve at the top
of the module allows you to see what information is lost: ideally the
curve should not touch the top or bottom of the frame. If you get this
curve, you've destroyed your shadows:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Clipped shadows]({filename}filmic-curve-clipped-shadows.png)
  </div>

The sliders below "contrast" allow you to fine-tune the curve:

* "latitude" gives the range of the image considered as midtone, in
  which contrast will be increased.

* "balance shadows-highlight" allows giving more room either to
  shadows or to highlights.

* The "intent" drop-down controls the interpolation between points of
  the curve. The default usually provides good results but can also go
  really wrong (e.g. produce a non-monotonic curve) when you push the
  parameters to their extreme. Try other modes when this happens.

Increasing contrast often results in an increase of saturation, and
gamut clipping. The "saturation" slider allows decreasing the
saturation in the shadows and highlights to avoid this. On the other
hand, in highlights, darktable usually has to chose between preserving
the luminance and the chrominance. By default, it preserves the
luminance but the checkbox allows doing the opposite.

There's a hidden section "destination/display", useless for most
users. Expect ugly images if you use it without reading the manual and
knowing what you're doing!

### Final touch and local contrast

The contrast has been compressed in the sky, but we still see some
texture there. If we want to increase local contrast in the sky, the
*local contrast* module with a parametric mask on the brightest part of
the image gives this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Middle grey on the grass]({filename}filmic-and-local-contrast.jpg)
  </div>

### More documentation

This section gave you an overview of what's possible with the filmic
module. Obviously, you should read the darktable manual for more
details. For more information (more technical details, comparison with
other techniques, examples on real-life images, ...), you may also
read the article
"[Filmic, darktable and the quest of the HDR tone mapping](https://eng.aurelienpierre.com/2018/11/30/filmic-darktable-and-the-quest-of-the-hdr-tone-mapping/)",
by Aurélien Pierre, the creator of the module.

<span id="duplicate" />
## Duplicate manager in darkroom

darktable allows you to maintain several history stacks for the same
image. In lighttable, using the "duplicate" button in the *selected
image* module, one gets a duplicate of the image: the RAW file is not
copied, but darktable keeps two distinct history stacks for this file.

darktable 2.6 makes it easier to work with duplicates, with a new
module on the left sidebar of the darkroom:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Duplicate manager]({filename}dm-initial.png)
  </div>

First, obviously, this module being in darkroom, it allows you to deal
with duplicates without leaving the darkroom. Second improvement, a
short comment can now be associated to each image. Suppose we want to
compare our image developed with *filmic* with a development using
exposure fusion in the *base curve* one. We can start with basic
exposure adjustment and keep this version for further development:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Duplicate manager]({filename}dm-basic.png)
  </div>

Then, clicking the "create duplicate of the image with same history
stack" button (![create duplicate]({filename}dm-create-duplicate.png))
yields a second duplicate on which we can apply our filmic-based
processing:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Duplicate manager]({filename}dm-filmic.png)
  </div>

To get another version, we select the first one (double-click) and
create another duplicate:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Duplicate manager]({filename}dm-fusion.png)
  </div>

To compare the images, a single long click on any duplicate shows this
version of the image with a "fit to screen" zoom level. You may have
to keep the mouse pressed until the image is re-computed to get the
overview the first time, but the operation is immediate afterwards so
you may click and release several times to get an instant before/after
comparison.

Notice that the thumbnails are only updated when you leave an image,
so the thumbnail for the image being edited is usually not up to date.

<span id="colorbalance" />
## Revamp of the *color balance* module

The color balance has been considerably improved. Although its name
contains "color", it is actually a much more general module. It can
adjust levels pretty much like the *levels* module, and can now
also tweak the contrast with an S-shaped curve. Obviously, you can
also still adjust the colors to add or remove a color cast in the
shadows, highlight and midtones separately.

The module gains two modes to work in ProPhotoRGB mode. Also, you now
have the choice between the old RGBL (Red, Green, Blue, Luma) sliders,
and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luma).

Let's play with the module on an image with multiple white balances.
This is the original image, with only the basic modules activated, and
base curve disabled:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![]({filename}cb-active-modules.jpg)
  </div>

The snow is obviously white in the real scene, but the snow exposed to
the sun reflects the sun's light, while the one in the shadow reflects
the sky's light, much bluer. The color picker module in the right
sidebar of the darkroom allows visualizing and quantifying these color
casts:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![]({filename}cb-patches-original.png)
  </div>

(The negative value for the 'b' channel represents the blue color)

The *color balance* module now has color pickers to neutralize the
colors. On this image, the global optimizer works rather well. After
one click on "neutralize colors", the blue cast in the shadows is
reduced:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![]({filename}cb-picker-neutralize.jpg)
  </div>

Looking more carefully at the patches selected by the picker, notice
that the 'b' value is now much closer to 0:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![]({filename}cb-patches-neutralized.png)
  </div>

If the global optimizer guesses wrong, it is possible to specify color
patches for highlights, shadows and mid-tones (preferably in this
order) separately with the corresponding color pickers, and if needed
re-launch the "neutralize colors" (called "neutralize colors from
patches" once you have selected these patches).

Similarly, the tones can be adjusted similarly to the *levels* module,
either with the global "optimize luma" or with individual pickers.

The "master" section at the top allows adjusting the global contrast
and saturation. "contrast fulcrum" and "contrast" apply an S-shaped
curve, centered around the fulcrum, and with a slope given by the
contrast. In other words, with a positive contrast, parts of the image
below the fulcrum will be darkened and parts above it will have their
luminance increased:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![]({filename}cb-contrast.jpg)
  </div>

## Edge-aware bluring for blend masks

The "blend" feature of darktable allows selecting a part of the image,
called the mask, and applying the transformation of a module
selectively to this part. After creating a mask (drawn, parametric),
one can soften the edges of this mask with a blurring.


darktable 2.6 gives more control on the way mask blurring is
performed. To understand how it works, let's look at the two main
kinds of blurring. The common one is "gaussian blur", and gives roughly
the same effect as an incorrectly focused photo. In gaussian blur, the
value (luma and chroma) of each pixel is spread uniformly to the
neighboring pixels. The influence of a pixel reduces with the
distance. In darktable, Gaussian blurring is available in the low-pass
module:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}gaussian-blur.jpg)
  </div>

Another very useful kind of blurring is the
[bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter),
sometimes called "surface blurring" (because of the name of the
corresponding tool in Photoshop), or edge-aware blurring. In this mode,
the value of each pixel is spread to the neighboring pixels, but the
influence of a pixel is also reduced when the pixels have different
values. For example:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}edge-aware-blur.jpg)
  </div>

A similar blurring algorithm can be applied to the mask, but this time
the mask is blurred, and the image being processed serves as a blur
guide. This allows doing a very rough approximation of a mask, and
refining precisely with the sliders.

Suppose we want to improve the color of the sky. In the *color zones*
module, we can select the sky approximately with a drawn mask:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask.jpg)
  </div>

Obviously, a Gaussian blur on this mask (i.e. the only available with
darktable 2.4) only makes things worse:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask-gauss.jpg)
  </div>

However, pushing the "feathering radius" slider, the mask
automatically adjusts to the sky, without spreading to the mountains.
The feathering reduced the opacity of the mask a little, but we can
compensate this with the "mask opacity" slider. And voilà:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask-feather.jpg)
  </div>

Note that by pushing the "feathering radius" and "mask opacity"
sliders, one gets a tool similar to the "magic wand" selection of
GIMP, often requested by darktable users: select a few pixels inside
an area to select, and let the tool select surrounding similar pixels.
For example, a brush stroke inside the house:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Brush, without feathering]({filename}gb-brush-nofeather.jpg)
  </div>

And now with feathering:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Brush, with feathering]({filename}gb-brush-feather.jpg)
  </div>

# Lighttable and map improvements

* Searching for a location from the map view was fixed:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Searching for a location in the map view]({filename}map-search.png)
  </div>

* The look of the lighttable has been improved. The background text
  showing the image format was often unreadable because it was hidden
  by the picture. The state of the local copy is now displayed in the
  top right corner.

* One can now sort images by aspect ratio (possibly after cropping
  within darktable):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Sort by aspect ratio]({filename}lt-sort-by.png)
  </div>

* It is also possible to specify the order manually, by selecting
  "custom sort" and then drag-and-dropping the images to reorder them:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Custom sort]({filename}lt-custom-sort.png)
  </div>

* Collections can be filtered by aspect ratio, shutter speed
  (exposure) and state of local copy:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Collection filters]({filename}lt-collection-filters.png)
  </div>

* When selecting a filter to collect images, the number of images
  corresponding to each filter is displayed. In the example below, 13
  images were taken at 1/2000 and 27 at 1/1600:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Number of images per collection]({filename}lt-collection-nb.png)
  </div>

## Finer control on noise for profiled denoise and raw denoise

New curves have been introduced to give finer control for the "wavelet" mode of profiled denoise as well as the raw denoise module.
These curves allow controlling the force of denoising frequency by frequency.
In other words, you can adapt the force of the denoising to the noise coarseness.
The "all" curve allow to change the force for all channels at the same time, while "R", "G" and "B" curves allow changing the force separately for red, green, and blue channels.
It was already possible to denoise red, green and blue channels
selectively using the "RGB red/green/blue channel" blend modes, but
the new module can do this with a single instance and no blending.

Let's see an example of what can be done with the "all" curves first.
First, zoom into the image to be at a 100% zoom level.
At smaller zoom levels the result is an approximation, which is not always accurate.
Let's activate the denoise profiled, in wavelet mode.
A force between 0.150 and 0.3 is usually a good starting point.
Here, to better see the influence of the curve, we use a force of 0.5.

Here is the image we obtain with a flat curve:
  <div style="text-align: center">
![Boat denoised using a flat curve]({filename}wavelets_flat.png)
  </div>

Now, by lowering the force on a specific frequency, we can obtain very different results.
Here is what we obtain when lowering the force on a quite coarse frequency:
  <div style="text-align: center">
![Boat denoised with less reduction on the central frequency]({filename}wavelets_coarse_noise.png)
  </div>
The result is not pleasing to the eyes because coarse grain noise are very disturbing.
Here, we reduced the denoising force too much.

Let's try the same test on the finest frequency:
  <div style="text-align: center">
![Boat denoised with less reduction on the finest frequency]({filename}wavelets_details.png)
  </div>
Here, we obtain an image which is much less disturbing than the last one: the fine grain noise is less distrurbing than the coarse grain one.
This image is even arguably more natural than the one with a flat curve.

By playing with the different frequencies, on can get better trade-offs between smoothing and detail preservation.

In addition, new presets are now available for the *denoise (profiled)* module that exploits this curve:

* one for chroma noise (false colors), where the denoising is increased for fine details, as the color should not change much from one pixel to another.

* one for luma noise (false luminance), where the denoising is reduced on finest details and some coarse scales. It aims at providing a nice trade-off between noise and smoothing for pictures that are not too noisy (forget about extended ISO values for instance. For such pictures we have to use less automatic strategies).

The chroma preset should be used on the first instance, and the luma preset on the second instance.

For images that are more complicated, or if you want to get an even better trade-off, you can use the RGB curves.
Indeed, the sensors usually capture R, G, and B values.
Depending on the lighting on the scene, the channels can exhibit different noise characteristics:

* one of the channel may be more (or even much more) noisy than the other

* one channel may have coarser noise than another

You can try to get a better denoising trade-off by denoising the channels separately, using the RGB curves and an instance of channel mixer used to visualize the channels:
  <div style="text-align: center">
![Denoising the red channel]({filename}wavelets_red.png)
  </div>
Once RGB channels have been denoised, you can use another instance in color blend mode to remove remaining color problems.

Note that denoising RGB channels individually should be done *before* using an instance in color blend mode, as doing this will mix the channels and change the characteristics of noise.

These explanations were all using the *denoise (profiled)* module as an
example, but you can follow the same steps with the *raw denoise* module.
Also note that the tip of denoising RGB channels separately while visualizing the channels using the channel mixer is also useful to set the parameters of the *denoise bilateral* module.

## A new "log" mode for *unbreak input profile*

Similarly to the logarithmic shaper in the *filmic* module, the
*unbreak input profile* module is now equipped with a logarithmic mode,
with the same sliders and pickers. The difference is that *unbreak
input profile* comes before the application of the input profile,
while *filmic* comes later in the pipeline.

Using the log mode of *unbreak input profile* usually results in a
pale image, lacking contrast. For example, on the
[Mairi Troisieme](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/playraw-mairi-troisieme/967)
image, we may get this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Pale image after unbreak input profile]({filename}unbreak-fade.jpg)
  </div>

Getting a fade image is indeed the point: the logarithmic mode in
*unbreak input profile* is meant to be used in conjunction with
another module later in the pipeline to give more pep to the image
(for example the color *balance module*, especially with the new
features in this version). The advantage of this flow is that most of
the pipeline, in particular the application of the input color
profile, is done on an image that fills in the histogram properly, and
without extreme values. In other words, we distinguish a technical
part of the edit and an artistic part. Back to our image, the
*color balance* module allows for example this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Vivid image after color balance]({filename}unbreak-colorbalanced.jpg)
  </div>

Note that in this workflow, it is mandatory to work in the same order
as the pipeline does: trying to adjust the settings of *unbreak input
profile* after tuning the levels and contrast with *color balance* is
doomed to failure.

In practice, the *filmic* module can do more or less the same, but has
the advantage of having everything in a single module for a quicker
edit.

## Ability to adjust the opacity of each stoke in *spot removal*

The *spot removal* tool benefited from some of the cool features of
*retouch*. For example, it is now possible to set the opacity of the
shapes individually (control+scroll).

## Improvement of monochrome RAW files support

While it is possible to turn any RAW image into monochrome, some
cameras have no color filters in front of their sensors, and produce
monochrome RAW files. Previous versions of darktable allowed disabling
the *demosaic* module for monochrome RAW. This version improves the
treatment of these images further by disabling chromatic aberration
correction, turn of the *white balance* module (if only to avoid
spurious error messages), and re-enable normal processing such as
auto-exposure which was disabled in previous versions.

## Improvement of multiple modules instance support

### Ability to rename module instances

When using multiple instances of the same module for different purposes, it is often hard to remember which instance serves which purpose.
darktable now allows giving a name to each instance to simplify this.
For example, if you use two instances of denoise profile, one for chrominance noise, and one for luminance noise, you may set the name of the first one as "chroma", and the name of the second one as "luma".
The steps for setting the name of the chroma instance are described bellow:

* first, click on the "multiple instance action" button

* click on "rename"

* enter the name

* press "enter" on your keyboard

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Renaming an instance]({filename}rename.png)
  </div>

### Cut-and-paste improvement

## Ratio-preserving crop in the perspective correction module

The perspective correction module now allows a semi-automatic cropping
preserving the original image's format:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Automatic cropping to original format]({filename}pc-original-format.png)
  </div>

Just drag the mouse over the image to select the portion to crop:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cropping an image]({filename}pc-crop-image.jpg)
  </div>

The area is adjusted automatically to avoid including black parts in
the target image. This avoids having to switch to the *crop and
rotate* module.

# Usability improvements

## Contextual help

darktable is a complex beast to master, and reading the manual for the
feature you're trying to use is often a good idea, even if you already
read the full manual once.

This version introduces a contextual help to help users: a "?" button
is available on the top-right of the interface, next to the
"preferences" button:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Contextual help]({filename}contextual-help.png)
  </div>

Once clicked, the mouse turns into a question mark when hovering any
element of the interface for which help is available:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Contextual help activated]({filename}contextual-help-active.png)
  </div>

One click opens your browser on the corresponding section of the
documentation.

## Module organization into tabs

The distribution of modules into groups, or tabs ("basic group", "tone
group", "color group", "correction group" and "effects group") is now
customizable. The original distribution in darktable follows a
thematic categorization, but some users prefer grouping by stages in
the workflow. For example, *demosaic* is currently categorized in the
color group because it deals with colors, but it comes very early in
the pipe hence may impact almost all other modules, hence it makes
sense to categorize it in the basic group.

A re-categorization was proposed, but discussions between developers
couldn't reach a consensus, since changing the groups may disturb
old-timers used to the legacy layout. The trade-off in darktable 2.6
is to have a customizable layout. You may change the layout manually
by editing the `.config/darktable/darktablerc` file, or use one of the
scripts provided in the source distribution of darktable:
`tools/iop-layout.sh` to adopt the new layout, and
`tools/iop-layout-legacy.sh` to revert to the legacy layout. Edit
these scripts if needed to create your custom layout. These scripts
are meant for advanced users who know how to execute a script, and may
or may not work on Windows. If a consensus is reached on the best
possible layout, it may be adopted in future releases of darktable so
that all users can benefit from it.

## Import/export to other software

* The Adobe Lightroom importer was improved (“creator”, “rights”,
  “title”, “description” metadata are copied from Lightroom to
  darktable).

* A new script is provided to import collections from Capture One Pro
  (`tools/migrate_capture_one_pro.sql` in the source code of darktable).

## Tone curve

The user-interface of the tone curve has been improved in several
ways. First, you can now use a log scale on the x axis, y axis, or
both:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Log-log scale on tone curve]({filename}tone-curve-loglog.png)
  </div>

This makes it easier to manipulate points close to 0, i.e. finely
tweak the part of the curve affecting shadows.

It is also possible to chose the algorithm used for interpolation,
i.e. for computing the curve itself based on the control points edited
by the user. There were already several algorithms available, but
hidden to the user. For example, selecting the preset "contrast - high
(linear)" was picking a cubic spline for you. For very smooth curves,
the interpolation algorithm doesn't change much on the result, but for
curves using points close to each other it may make a dramatic change.

For example, let's look at the same set of control points with
different interpolations. The cubic spline gives a very smooth curve,
but may give a non-monotonic result, i.e. a contrast inversion on the
resulting image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cubic spline]({filename}tone-curve-cubic.png)
  </div>

The centripetal spline reduces the potential for non-monotonicity:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Centripetal spline]({filename}tone-curve-centripetal.png)
  </div>

The monotonic spline, used by default, may be less smooth but avoids
non-monotonicity by construction:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Monotonic spline]({filename}tone-curve-monotonic.png)
  </div>

## Other improvements

* More widgets are themable through CSS. In particular, some widgets
  hardcoded a light foreground and black background so it was not
  possible to make a clean white background theme.

* 50%, 400%, 800% and 1600% zoom level are available in darkroom mode.
  While most operations provided by darktable are meant to improve the
  overall image tone and colors, it is sometimes interesting to get a
  precise pixel-level view of a small part of the image. The highest
  zoom factor previously available (200%) was not always sufficient,
  especially on high-dpi screens. Note that these zoom levels are
  available from the menu in the preview area, but not with mouse
  wheel.

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![1600% Zoom Level]({filename}zoom-1600.png)
  </div>

* All masks are previewed and can be adjusted before being drawn. This
  also applies to the *liquify* module's shapes.

* The color picker's behavior has been reworked. For example the
  picker in the exposure module wasn't disabled when the module was
  disabled. This is becoming more important as more and more modules
  use a color picker (*filmic*, *unbreak input profile*, *color balance*).
