We are sorry to inform you that we had to disable comments on this website. Currently there are more than 21 thousand messages in the spam queue plus another 2.6 thousand in the review queue. There is no way we can handle those. If you want to get in touch with us then head over to the [contact page](/contact/) and find what suits you best&nbsp;– mailing lists, IRC, bug tracker, …
We hope to be able to get some alternative up and running, but that might take some time as it's not really a high priority for us.
