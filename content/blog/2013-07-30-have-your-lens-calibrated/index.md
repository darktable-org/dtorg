just a quick plug for torsten's great new service which allows you to calibrate your lens for lensfun. this will enable you to use darktable's lens correction module with your lens if it hasn't been calibrated by others for you yet.

all you need to do is take some sample images and upload them here:

[http://wilson.bronger.org/calibration](http://wilson.bronger.org/calibration)

the page contains some more detailed instructions about which images are useful and which aren't.

enjoy!
