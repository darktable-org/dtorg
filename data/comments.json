There's no real reason to use DNG for this application as I think the vuescan output is just a normal color image not a raw. For a scan you almost surely don't need a color matrix as vuescan probably already outputs converted color so the warning should also be benign.",

I don't think bunch of Windows related mess in the code would help this project, either in stability, speed or development. Seriously, nowadays Linux is so easy to run, even in emulator such as VirtualBox or VMware. Linux users run, emulators for Windows software, why Windows users cannot run emulator for Linux software ? Please, just DON'T spoil another great project. Mac OS is Unix based, so port should be easier, and shouldn't hurt that much general community, but porting to Windows, will probably hurt everyone. Please make easy to maintain and clean code for compatible, Unix based architecture, don't follow inefficient ideas. Having clean code for single platform, really allows developers to focus on developing features that can be used by professional photographers instead of putting efforts in maintaining multi-platform inefficient mess.<br/><br/>Keep on with good work! <br/>Kind regards,<br/>Mateusz",

Around 70% of Luminance's users are on Windows and I couldn't ignore them. However, I soon realized that, being also the more computer-wise immature (no serious computer lover would use Windows without knowing the implications), I had to understand their bug reports even when they didn't really had much sense at first glance (headache mode on!).<br/>I have the say that Luminance made a BIG step forward when Daniel (Luminance's Windows maintainer, I will never thank him enough) managed to compile Luminance using Visual Studio. Since that day, Luminance become more stable, fast and reliable, which also helped all of us to harvest the huge amount of bugs that were inserted by MinGW (I personally believe MinGW cannot be used to compile serious applications, like Darktable).<br/>However, your situation is different, because you never officially supported Windows before (while Luminance HDR has been released on Windows since its born). My suggestion is to look for a maintainer of the Windows build, which work in synergy with you to keep the quality of the product to the same standard level than the build for Linux. Only at that stage, I would release officially for Windows. Otherwise, I would personally stay away from an official Windows support.",

Filters: There are some nice filters and plugins for Photoshop/Lightroom, for example Nik filters, that would be great to have for darktable. I understand that this may not be possible to implement, but do you have any comments on that?<br/>6. Batch processing: I'm using Capture NX2 and am able to store the settings and then use them for batch processing selected or all photos in a folder. Is that possible with darktable (sorry, I haven't played with darktable enough to find that, and I haven't seen a blog on batch processing)?<br/><br/>Under Windows, I can have a complete workflow, with all the bells and whistles. This includes monitor calibration (using the NEC Spectraview software and colorimeter to upload 14 bit profiles into the screen), RAW conversion for the latest cameras using Capture NX2, Lightroom or whatever, photo editing in PS, and output in different file formats or on printer (I use the old Epson 2100, but have access to Epson 3880 and large format printers up to A1).<br/><br/>ArgyllCMS may cover the calibration, though I would have to live with some limitations (only 8-bit and no upload to the screen, i.e. only LUT). The other missing piece is DAM (digit asset management), which I believe darktable could solve with full IPTC support, tagging and search functions. Printer output - well, I don't know. Haven't really tried it under Linux. In the end, what really counts is the result. Any suggestions are welcome.<br/><br/>So, to me the Linux environment is still somewhat behind commercial Windows or Mac solutions. I really would like to make it all work under Linux. I am also prepared to spend money on it (a Windows license itself costs around $150 to $400, only for the bloody OS, let alone the other licenses I need and purchased).<br/><br/>What I'm saying here is that your darktable project looks like it's heading the right direction - providing the most advanced photo editing/RAW conversion solution available today. If only all the missing pieces would fall into place. Which workflow do you suggest to advanced armature or pro photographers?<br/><br/>You guys got my hopes high for an all-Linux solution. Thank you again for your hard work in an outstanding project.",

      "comment" : "The topic sure is interesting.<br/><br/>I have some free time, so I was thinking of possible hacks and improvements to some of my favourite FOSS out there. The first thing that struck me was that I could port Darktable to Windows. After all, I thought that it ought not take too much time. Then I came across this post...<br/><br/>I think that Darktable under Windows would be a useful addition. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Linux. I use it whenever I have to programme. But when it comes to usability, I cannot deny that my computer performs better under Windows (for a variety of reasons, including closed source drivers and hardware). This means that I am restricted to using software available for Windows while I'm working in Windows. In such a case, having Windows binaries works wonders.<br/><br/>As for the package managers, that's BS. I mean, repos in Ubuntu are hardly updated, we have to resort to third party repositories. Luminance still is in 1.9.3 in the Ubuntu repos (by contrast, I'm on 2.3 beta in Windows).<br/><br/>I guess Windows does have a lot of issues, but I think that there is a huge amount of users out there who want decent software; they are being denied the opportunity to use some of the best FOSS out there, just because we are being too finicky about the people who use our software.<br/><br/>I think that the idea of a fork, with a developer dedicated to the Windows version of DT is a great idea. Maybe the Windows version may be a bit buggy, but I'm sure that the bugs will get ironed out in due course.",

      "comment" : "I'd like to try this, so loading up a VM on my windows box with a linux distro is not too bad.   However, if I like it, I don't want to run it in a vm.   I'd like to have a windows native compile.   <br/><br/>Quick background statement:<br/>I'm a linux guy from way back.   I like it.    I use it part of the time at work (but not most of the time).    However, everyone that I live with (wife, kids) are all windows people.   I don't have the means to run multiple boxes, so windows is a reality for me and for my family.    <br/><br/>Your argument boils down to the assumption that all windows users are ignorant users, not programmers, and don't contribute to projects.   That's probably true 90% of the time, but not all the time.    The same thing is probably true of the linux community, although at a lower percentage.   *MOST* consumers of free and open source programs don't contribute code back to the project.   <br/><br/>Really, the way that you talk about it in your post, it seems that you have a general distaste for all things windows and all things mac.   Is your bias driving your decision?    <br/><br/>Ultimately, you're saying \"what's the benefit to us?   What do we get out of a windows build?\"  The reality is that you get to do good things for other people - some of whom won't get it and won't appreciate it - but the vast majority will.    That's why releasing gimp on windows was a good idea.   <br/><br/>Anyway, there is another alternative.   Don't release windows binaries or installer.   But, publish instructions on how to port the software to windows.   I've never done it, but I am very interested in giving it a try.   I think that I'd learn a lot.<br/><br/>Something like a \"howto\" would do it.   That way, you'd attract the user base that you want, in windows.   Who knows?   You may end up with valuable contributions that you never expected, and never would have gotten from a strictly linux world.",

      "comment" : "You overrate my opinion about Windows (and Mac) users. It's not even that getting a compilable version is that hard. The real hassle is keeping it up-to-date and maintaining the dependencies. When looking at GIMP or Inkscape that's really non-trivial and needs someone dedicated to it for more than just the short time it takes to release a first binary. If these things aren't maintained for the foreseeable future they suffer bitrot and will need to be removed again. And noone will like that.<br/><br/>Btw: I don't think that \"you get to do good things for other people\" is a valid argument. To be honest, when I get told what to do I tend to do the opposite. So never tell me what to do. We owe nothing to anyone. We just do what we like to do.<br/><br/>The official conclusion to this topic was:<br/><br/>\"We will not port darktable to Windows. The only exception is when someone shows up and proves that he's able and willing to maintain that platform. This is not so much about our code base but building and bundling all the libraries we depend on.\"",

This is such a consumer mentality that shouldn't apply to open-source and public domain software. That is why it is public domain. It's everyone's responsibility to maintain it. But this sense of entitlement that these kind of users have, as if they are throwing their hard earned money at you for professional support is even more aggravating. Another classic consumer mentality is that the software is not \"competitive\" enough. Instead of being grateful that there actually IS any kind of free public domain tool, available to everyone they keep being miserable. In the end, I guess there's no helping some people. I guess the best answer to give to them is that if they want \"proper\" support (hardly a good analogy because there are open source projects with extremely responsive developers) they should pay for it in the form of a \"proper\" commercial alternative.",

Darktable has a few of the most-used fields available, but I use nearly every editable field in the IPTC standard as I annotate images -- categories, source, credits, instructions and on down to the IPTC contact info I find critical to let those who find my images find me.<br/><br/>Please continue developing this feature!<br/><br/>Thanks.",

I learned a lot and have had a fiddle separating some shades in a/b as well - what surprised me wasn't just the separation but I managed (stunningly easily but perhaps more by accident than judgement) to get a much more pleasing and natural  enhancement on some blue reflecting water than I could manage with colour zones.<br/><br/>I love the separation on your 'jungle' foliage and feel abit inspired to rework a couple of my Bali shots where it is also mostly about the greens. Looking at your jungle shot  I see the downside to the green separations on the foliage is the slate blue tone the watercouse has taken on - anyone for masks????<br/><br/>Also, I can see how the a/b curves give you the control on reg/green and yellow/blue axis, but what is the approach if you wanted to separate red/yellow or blue/green I wonder?",

It's not an \"alternative\" anymore; there are many valid reasons to choose it in the first place, besides being \"free\" (in both senses of the word). I didn't have any major problems with the interface, but I was always thinking that the sliders were a bit awkward - sometimes I had to type in order to choose a value precisely enough.<br/><br/>The new sliders look (and most probably feel) awesome! Perhaps you should file a patent, before Apple does and then starts suing FOSS projects left and right (I'm only joking... well, half-joking).<br/><br/>I'm not so sure about the combobox, but we'll see in practice.<br/><br/>I've always found Bauhaus extremely interesting - not so much when it comes to the results, as in terms of the underlying principles. Function-over-form; but not without beauty and elegance. Beauty, however, was somehow redefined in terms of functionality. As such, Bauhaus is certainly inspiring. I feel that this type of functional \"elegance\" is the essence of mathematics and engineering - all types of engineering, including software.<br/><br/>As an amateur photographer, Linux user and CS major, I can only hope that you keep up the good work!<br/><br/>PS.

Today I played a bit with bauhaus, but must say that I did not fall in love with it till now.<br/><br/>Here are my main issues I have with it:<br/><br/>- the graphical element of sliders is now extremely retracted compared to the text. The small graphical triangle element has no clear reference to a minimum or maximum value. This makes it more difficult for me to get an immediate feeling for the selected value within its range. I now have to refer more to the text, which gets even more prominent.<br/><br/>- when switching into fine tuning mode, the main graphical elements are curved, mainly vertical lines. I am impressed by the mechanism of different levels of fine tuning, but i feel that the manipulation elements have a higher dominance now than the slider value itself. A lot of movement of the vertical lines that try to control a small triangle on the (virtual) horizontal line. For me the horizontal line should get more attention as it represents the value I want to change.<br/><br/>Generally speaking I would wish to have a more prominent horizontal feature for sliders and less text dominance.<br/><br/>As said, these are just my personal impressions and I am really looking forward to see the further progress.",

For instance, take a look at the slider. The handle appears to be floating, rather than having a guided rail. There is no longer a sense of a left and right boundary. Also, the handle floats over the label, interfering with the readability of the text.

Assuming it is a symbolic link, follow it to find out what library it finally points to. <br/><br/>Most likely you find a revision number in that name. Check if this fits to the revision number of your graphics driver setup including the other relevant libraries and the kernel module!<br/><br/>Make sure, that the right kernel module is really loaded, not a left-over one from an older driver version. In case of NVIDIA cards, pay  special attention that the free \"nouveau\" kernel driver is *not* loaded. In doubt, blacklist the nouveau driver.<br/><br/>Check if everything is complete. I for example run an NVIDIA setup under openSUSE. I need to install two RPMs to get everything working, one rpm (x11-video-nvidiaG02) for the X11 driver and a separte one (nvidia-computeG02) for GPU computing.

So i went back to the stable version 1.0.5 and tried again - the results for opening and enlarging the same picture:<br/>[dev_process_image] pixel pipeline processing took 0.324 secs (0.194 CPU) with opencl<br/>[dev_process_image] pixel pipeline processing took 0.965 secs (2.251 CPU) without opencl<br/><br/>and best of all- until now no freezes (i haven't played around a lot, though).<br/><br/>I usually do not write comments, but your work is absolutely fantastic, and it is fun to play around with it - Thanks a lot for the work you are putting in this project!<br/><br/>Ok, just now darktable segfaulted and gave this message:<br/>[opencl_atrous] couldn't enqueue kernel! -5 (might this be connected to my limited video memory?)<br/>Never mind, it's fun to play around with this feature all the same",

Simply remove your database file (user/config/darktable) so the lighttable appears empty of images, and add each image to be edited individually, removing them again after export.

There seems to be some really nice features in it.<br/>The couple of time I've tried it, I've also been quite frustrated with the curve tool. That is the main reason why I have only used it for testing. I want to manipulate the curve the way I like; add as many points as I wish, bend the curve as I wish. I'm not always looking for natural look. Please consider adding a button: \"remove guides\".<br/><br/>The second slight disappointment is the highlight recovery. At least AfterShot Pro seems to do a lot better in that section. <br/><br/>Keep up the good work!",

The option of system update to a 64 bits version I would like to try it in a partition before to install it definetly to test all problems I can find, but I'll do it in a future. I'll improve my RAM before and I'll test 1.0 version for second time. In the other hand, I have 2 sony, A100 and A580. When I work with pictures taked with A100, I can choose pre-defined white balance  options like cloudy, sunny... but I can't do that with pictures taked with A580, Somebody know why?<br/>Thanks!!!<br/>Regards from Spain!!!",

      "comment" : "Hi, <br/><br/>First I must say thank you so much for your work on Darktable. It's been nearly a year that I use it for all my raw developement and editing (DNG from a pentax kx). I am very pleased with it and all the new features that are constantly added to brew (keep it this way!). By the way, I love the level widget, I no longer have to use gimp for this one. <br/>Thanks to you, all my image work flow is done with open source softwares! <br/><br/>But now with the stuff that I'm less happy with : <br/>[I'm currently running Darktable 1.0.3 updated via synaptic from the 0.9<br/>on Ubuntu 11.10 on an AMD phenom X4 64 bit and a GeForce GTS450 plus 8 Go of RAM]<br/><br/>I noticed the followings: <br/><br/>- hdr creation in the light table panel will make darktable crash as soon as there are more than one dng selected. This weird behavior started with v1.0.<br/>- tone mapping is completely off. I'm positive this a regression of the feature. It produces some weird line along the tone of the pic and the overall the pic look like I applied a cut off filter, reducing the color range. The lines appears in the preview as well as in the final output.<br/>I'm don't think I can provide you a bug report on this one.<br/><br/>Thank you for your help!<br/><br/>Pascal",

I might be very down-to-earth on the matter, but Darktable seems to be the only program that I know about that produces this result; with the sams pictures, I have no such problem with Digikam derawtiser, RawTherapee or UFRAW. <br/>So why Darktable does have this problem?

Does it means that the WB presets in DT matches the Camera WB at the same settings? For example, if we choose the Daylight WB in DT, will the color tint and temperature we get be exactly as what we will get from the in-Camera WB of the same preset?<br/><br/>Also, is it possible to make Spot WB the default WB when opening new pictures? I always shoot using in-camera AWB and it seems that when I use the DT's Spot WB (with the whole picture evaluated) I get better colors, but it is tedious to have to open each picture just to change the WB to Spot.<br/><br/>Thanks again!",

There are some really great innovations in this product and I'm impressed with the open, community oriented development.  A few suggestions to the developers:<br/><br/>1.  It would be great if you could put up an \"app\" page for developers and users to showcase their plugins, presets, and styles.  You'd soon have a rich ecosystem around the product.<br/><br/>2.  Could you add layers and selective editing tools too?  Gimp and PSP have this feature but those tools are complex and hard to use.  ASP has it too and the integration in an easy to use interface makes ASP really nice.<br/><br/>3.  Wavelet sharpen and noise reduction would be a nice addition.<br/><br/>4.  The crop tool is a little awkward to use.  Its location as a plugin is also non-intuitive.  It should be located on the margin of the image so that users can crop easily at any time.<br/><br/>5.  Printing - I use Turboprint.  Gimp integrates Turboprint if you have it installed.  Would be wonderful if you could add this too.<br/><br/>Many thanks and keep up the marvelous work!",

      "comment" : "Hi Steven,<br/><br/>glad to hear you like darktable. A few comments:<br/><br/>1. We already thought about this, maybe we'll get something like this.<br/><br/>2. Interesting that you compare darktable (so: a raw development tool) to Gimp and PS instead of Aftershot and LR. The purpose is completely different and if you need really sophisticate edits you'll need one of the others anyway. Having said this: We already have some selective editing (called blend-if, see here: http://www.darktable.org/2012/03/upcoming-features-conditional-blending/) and we started working on \"masks\" that can be drawn onto the image. But since the implementation is complex and we don't want to deliver half-done stuff don't expect this soon.<br/><br/>3. Taker a look at our equalizer, Imho one of the most powerful wavelet based tools out there, for both sharpen and/or denoise. Described here: http://www.darktable.org/2011/11/darktable-and-research/<br/><br/>4. I don't agree here.<br/><br/>5. There are plans to provide a printing interface in darktable - but this is nothing that will come on a short time scale. We just don't have the manpower to do this in a few months.<br/><br/>I recommend you reading our blog - you will discover lots of partly hidden functions and features you will love.<br/>http://www.darktable.org/category/blog/<br/><br/>cheers,<br/>Simon",

Actually I think many of the G'MIC filters would benefit darktable.<br/><br/>So aside from the backwards-compatible shadows/highlight module, and the denoising module using the permutohedral lattice... darktable no longer uses regular bilateral filter?<br/><br/>Some quick points:<br/><br/>I'd be nice if you could post the original input to the tone-mapping module. As a general rule of thumb I've always found global tone-mapping flat and dull (and some non-global ones too, as found in pfstools, requiring too much post-process). Honestly, darktable's tonemapping has been the worst of the bunch. On the other hand local tone-mapping, unless correctly configured, often looks cheap... I wouldn't be surprised if the original image looks better.<br/> <br/> It's hilarious that with the new bilateral filter the tip of the left greenish pole is blackened.

To apply all GPS information to all pictures use<br/>exiftool −overwrite_original_in_place -r -tagsFromFile IMGP0087.JPG -gps:all .<br/>the -r option recurses into the directory (.)<br/><br/>However, this should be done before open the pictures in darktable, because later on darktable 1.1.1 does not show the updated GPS information.<br/><br/>Further more it would be nice to get Geotag functionality in darktable and be able to select other pictures and copy the GPS information to them e.g. history stack.<br/><br/>Would it be possible to modify the history stack so the user can choose what to apply to other pictures e.g. only GPS or only WB or both, ...?<br/><br/>Thank you in advance.",

I must say that except for the black squares everywhere in the preview, I really liked what I saw so far (and still no crash after prost-processing half a dozen HDR files coming from Luminance)<br/><br/>What I liked : <br/><br/>- Thank you, you finally moved monochrome in the color tab !<br/>- sliders are much easier to use, especially in the crop / resize / rotate. The additional 90° rotate is also a nice touch.<br/>- the global tonemap feature, it is great. Will we get as many algorithm as Luminance to play with in the near future? <br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, some stuff bugged me : <br/>-While I see the difference in visual results, it confuses me to have global tonemap and tonemapping as 2 different pluggin. <br/>- Grouping seems like a good idea, but It confuses me more as it is not obvious weither groups are collapsed or not. Something like a folder icon with a thumbnail would be more straighforward or at least a \"+\" sign. \"G\" is not really helpfull in this case.<br/>- the crop pluggin behavior is still weird (you still have to turn it off and on to modify the cropping window ). I got used to it by now anyway.<br/><br/><br/>As a side note, will we get local contrast and conditional blending in v1.1? <br/><br/><br/>In general, I am in awe before all the great work you have put into darktable. I cannot stop bringing it in when I am arguing about open source software quality.<br/><br/>Please, keep up the good work!",

      "comment" : "@Redi: Indeed, Ps is not the most user friendly, although they improved it since CS2. But Lr is, with its shortcuts provides the most intuitive workflow so far, and not just because I'm used to it. The only handicap it has is that they cripple it deliberately to force folks to use Ps to certain tasks like masking (by the way the OnOne Photo Suite is very interesting in that sense). I think this is the area where Darktable has the promise of a much better workflow and extended usability without the proprietary crap of Adobe, but only once it grows up in general usability as well. <br/><br/>@smn Sure, just copying in order be like Lr wouldn't make sense, but to enable the user to set shortcuts as he wants (in my case, as I've used it with Lr, which of course would evolve once I get the freedom), does I think. As well as to clearly differentiate sections of the UI to make it more transparent and intuitive.<br/><br/>However I tried it only on mac yet, so not v1.1.",

      "comment" : "I've been using various distros of Ubuntu since I quit Windows a year ago. My income is limited so until I can afford another camera with interchangeable lenses, I've been using a Canon Powershot SX40 HS. The model # on the bottom of my camera is PC1680. I can now shoot in RAW + JPEG, using CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit), as well as a plethora of other shooting options!! The RAW format is in DNG format. The lens is fixed, non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom (equivalent to 24mm to 840mm range). My workflow is first develop and adjust basic color/white balance with Darktable 1.0.5 , using Ubuntu 12.10(quantal) 64 bit/Ubuntu Studio distro.Then I finish up with Gimp 2.8.<br/> Since my camera/lens is not apparently listed in Darktable's choices, I've been playing with mostly Darktable's \"generic\" lens correction (when zoomed to wide or telephoto, I typically get vignetting and fisheye type distortion) and manually playing with DK's base curve and white balance plugins. So far pretty good.<br/>Do you have any suggestions on how to try to get best results in my situation?",

I was considering buying Lightroom and had just tested it (which also meant I needed to set up a temporary Windows computer).  <br/><br/>Default Denoise (profiled) settings on my particular photos created noticeable colour banding and removed fine textures (people where wearing colourful costumes with similar colours, feathers etc...).  Saying that, I compared to the photos produced by Lightroom and although they were slighyly better, also produced colour banding.  I then went back and very quickly tweaked the patch size and strength settings and the results were excellent. <br/><br/>Great work on the noise profiling!!!<br/><br/>Before I e-mail the profile, the camera has built in noise handling for high ISO and long exposures under custom settings, should I keep these at default?  Do we need profiles to take into account these settings or do they not impact the RAW images?<br/><br/>Just a note on how I compiled:<br/>* I installed as per the instructions on this website.

Would it also be possible to apply this noise model only to color information?  My reason for asking is that it seems in the examples that the algorithm may be a bit overzealous in removing information.  In the shadowy parts of the picture the fabric looks very smooth (e.g. at ISO 3200) whereas in the lighter parts there's still a sense of the texture of the material.  I guess that if you could remove only color noise the result may look more pleasant while textures would still be intact.",

You say \"go to the directory you just exported your images to\".  So do I understand correctly: I take the pictures, one for each ISO, apply the raw-linear style in darktable, then export and run gen-profile on the exported images (not the RAWs).  Usually people export JPGs but I wonder if the artifacts from the compression mess with the model fitting.  So what is the recommended export format?<br/><br/>Another question: the text says that whitebalance correction should be switched off (\"this makes sure we get linear camera raw rgb with no basecurves, no whitebalance, etc in the way\").  However, when I inspect the raw-linear stlye, darktable says that whitebalance is on under this style.  I would switch it off manually but that seems impossible as there is no switch for that in the GUI.<br/><br/>Thanks.",

In order to go to the a different sub-folder again is to collapse everything again. My image folder structure is very deep sometimes, so thats extremely annoying and makes working with dt almost impossible.<br/><br/>Is it possible to just let everything as it is.

      "comment" : "I really love the innovative use of conditional blend and multi-instance as demonstrated in the git versions.  But there remain some UI challenges in DT that makes working with it less than efficient.  Could you address some of these issues: <br/><br/>1.  To delete an image, you must go back to Light-table mode. Even there, you must play with the mouse. The [Delete] key on the keybrd doesn't even delete the file from the disk, but removes it from the Collection<br/><br/>2.  The file name doesn't show nor on the thumbnail &amp; in darkroom mode<br/><br/>3.   It is still quite challenging to remember the tool icons.  Couldn't you go back to naming the tabs with words instead of icons?<br/><br/>4.  It remains a challenge to find files easily as the capability to physically browse a folder/subfolder is hidden inside the collection lists.  I admit what we have now to search for files using different metadata is very powerful, but sometimes DT is too powerful and it sacrifices simplicity and speed for power.<br/><br/>5.  It is not possible to flag or rate files when in Darktable mode.  <br/><br/>6.  It still requires a double click to move from one file to another in the filmstrip.<br/><br/>7.  There are far too many plugins with similar features and the help explanations are terse.  Conditional blending is powerful but I am still confused by all the blending options, which are not explained in tooltip help or very well in the manual.<br/><br/>8.  Color zones is powerful but honestly slider bars for each color would be easier.  Often I just want to change one color, remove saturation, and darken it, without effecting all the other colors.  Or perform that on a region.  Nik Silver Effects has a wonderful way of doing this.  Lightroom also lets you choose a spot on the photo and apply changes by dragging up or down.  ASP lets you select regions and apply layers.  DT would really fly with the ability to apply selective edits with conditional blending.<br/><br/>So great progress and innovation.  The interface is still very intimidating and some consolidation and simplification would improve workflow.",

Thank you.  <br/><br/>We all understand that the four points you make are possible using various non-obvious methods.  My point is it would make the workflow easier if the methods were obvious, well explained, and intuititive.  I can find the filename in metadata, flag a file for deletion, remember the icons over time, find the folder view when I dig in, discover the shortcuts to rate files in Darktable view, and more - but these extra steps require the user to learn how your see the world.  Good interface design makes complex features intuitive to how the user sees the world.  Couldn't we have both?",

However, the DNG file still did not looked the same like JPEG. Would it be possible to get this feature, because it would help newbie to understand quicker how to work with RAW files.<br/><br/>2.<br/>It would be nice to double click on one of the entry in darkroom's history and jump straight to settings of the entry. Would it possible to switch off or to delete an entry in darkroom's history by additional icons next to the entry?<br/><br/>3.<br/>When I shot in burst mode I switched off Raw, because with only jpeg I have no worry about that buffer get to full and I miss the action. However, I have to modify the pictures in GIMP like whitening teeth, remove pimple etc. I thought to convert the JPEGs to Tiff in the following way:<br/>  convert IMGP0084.JPG IMGP0084.tif<br/>  convert IMGP0084.JPG exif:IMGP0084.exif<br/>  mogrify -set profile exif:IMGP0084.exif IMGP0084.tif<br/>However, in Tiff I lose most of the Exif entries like e.g GPS information. Are any plans to support exif files? Or how other user working around that problem to modify pictures?<br/><br/>Thank you in advance.",

I am observing darktable for a while and it's getting better and better, at the moment I try it as my full time RAW developer.<br/><br/>It would be great if you would work on an import option for ASP xmp-files also, I am very sure many people will appreciate that. The ASP sidecars are named the same as the darktable ones, and if I import pictures directly from the ASP directory without moving them, darktable is writing into the same files without overwriting them. But there is also a possibility in ASP to write minimal xmp-data, which are named as the Lightroom ones.<br/>I could help with this plugin by sending xmp-files for example. Where can I find the code for the LR plugin, maybe I could have a look at it and adopt it myself to the ASP sidecars, although my coding skills are quite limited.<br/><br/>Thanks for the great work anyway, I think I will fully switch to darktable at the near future!<br/><br/>With kind regards,<br/>M.F.",

My name is Ulrich and I currently take care of the manual to get everything updated for the upcoming 1.2 release. It would be really great to see the manual translated into different languages and I really appreciate your initiative!<br/><br/>I'd like to suggest the following: we are currently still doing some finetunings for the 1.2 version. This will take maybe one week or two. After that the English version has stabilized and that's the point where translations should start.<br/><br/>What I then would do is send to you a file where you find a list of English sentences/expressions and for each sentence a blank field where the French translation of that sentence should be put in. The file is just a plain text file. Any editor can be used to work on it. When you have finished your translation work you just send back that file and all is done.

Now that I shoot digital, darktable has finally given me my own lab :)<br/>This new mask feature is almost too much awesomeness. I wonder: with this feature in place, will full retouching and clone brushes become possible?

      "comment" : "Very, very impressed with DT, and this mask feature has won me back to it. I have bounced back and forth between Photivo, Rawtherapee, and DT for the past year, but always recognized DT was by-far the most ambitious overall, having unique features (like blending available in every module) that eventually would make it indispensible. But RT kept getting me back for technically trivial yet practically essential reasons that made workflow faster. For a start, being older, it is simply more clearly organized. For another, the large number of very useable presets accessible through a simple scroll box also helped me learn how to use it. And one last technically trivial and yet surprisingly critical difference: to adjust sliders with the scroll wheel in RT, i need to hold the Shift key. THIS IS GOOD. Why? Because (particularly in Ubuntu, where the blasted window scroll handles disappear unpredictably), i found that in both DT and Photivo, trying to move through modules using the scroll wheel was constantly inadvertently adjusting sliders, and i was wasting time and focus simply trying to \"navigate safely.\" Yes, idiotically small gripe, and yet when i needed to work fast, it really did make it a no-brainer to \"just use RT.\" Well, i hit a limit with RT yesterday that made me re-open DT, and to my surprise, it was not only better organized now (including the \"leave only one module expanded\" option - should be default!), but this masks ability is ridiciulously powerful. Well done. Now i'm going to gripe more about navigation/organization nusances, but that's only because DT has definitely taken the lead :-) Keep up the great work, folks.",

Suppose you have two monitors, one is standard gamut the other is wide gamut. Also suppose you have some raws that you have output to 8-bit sRGB and aRGB JPEGs and want to display. Does the pseudocode below capture sort of thing that you need to do?<br/><br/> sRGB = cmsCreate_sRGBProfile(); <br/> aRGB = // Load profile from image (assuming it is present)<br/> sgMon = // Load profile for standard gamut monitor (using EDID?)<br/> wgMon = // Load profile for wide gamut monitor (using EDID?)<br/> // generate the transforms<br/> // IN is one of sRGB and aRGB<br/> // OUT is one of sgMon and wgMon<br/> s2s = cmsCreateTransform(IN, TYPE_RGB_8, OUT, <br/> TYPE_RGB_8, 0, 0); <br/> // apply the transforms to the original image pixels (i.e. the JPG) then render the transformed image on the relevent screen<br/><br/>Now stepping back to how I got those JPEGs in the first place, what transform is applied to go from the raw to the sRGB (or aRGB) JPEG? Is there some camera profile that needs to be used at least as a starting point?<br/><br/>Thanks!",

      "comment" : "Rob, please do read the article, dm isn't far off at all... As I explicitly mention colord is just an infrastructure daemon which ties stuff together. It doesn't do any color transforms by itself (and it shouldn't).<br/><br/>As far as the pseudocode goes, you'd need to check Darktable code for the gritty details.<br/><br/>For a high level view, Darktable's pipeline is completely transparant in the user interface, if you turn off plugin grouping (by clicking the active group once again), you can see all steps which are applied from bottom to the top.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that RAW files technically aren't normal images to begin with, they inherently have their own sensor specific color space and are practically linear with regard to gamma. So a LOT of processing has to happen to get even a basic image.<br/><br/>The typical minimum steps are:<br/><br/>1. read sensor data from RAW<br/>2. Whitebalance (RGB multipliers)<br/>3. Demosaic (includes median filters/greeneq too)<br/>4. Basecurve (corrects for gamma/contrast/tonality)<br/>5. (CMS) Color In (Camera RGB -&gt; color (XYZ) matrix -&gt; LAB)<br/>7. more plugins (for example denoise)<br/>6. (CMS) Color Out (LAB -&gt; output ICC -&gt; sRGB or AdobeRGB)<br/>8. more plugins (for example sharpen)<br/><br/>Some of this is discussed in the following video:<br/>http://blog.pcode.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/darktable-darkroom-basics.ogv",

      "comment" : "I have been testing this program for the last 2-3 months, and I have to say it's the most powerful toolchain one can have to process raw files. Impressive work, and I doubt many (or any) highly priced soft can beat its processing capabilities in any manner.  Support for newest cameras is impressive too.<br/><br/><br/>However, I want to be totally honest too... (otherwise my comment would not be of any help) the GUI really needs some love. The application's gui design makes the process of developing raw files so slow when you want to process more than 2 or 3 pictures (I do 200 to 400 image batches usually in one go, every 1 or 2 weeks).<br/><br/>IMHO it would speed up the process a lot if:<br/><br/>- Most frequent tools were made available in the default toolbar (sharpen/levels/vibrance-saturation... I think it's quite rare to process any picture that does not use any of those?)<br/>- I do not understand why the tools have icons, if they are not used later on in the lists. That would help a lot locating the tools on long lists <br/>- It would also be nice  to divide the custom toolbar list into several categories. It's not easy to find anything when you have 20 of them enabled ( I have to enable all those not included by default here...)<br/>- A simple undo/redo from keyboard (rather than a history list) would be nice too<br/>- The need to import all files before processing them isn't very helpful when one uses other file managers to sort them.<br/><br/>Do you regularly run tests with your average userbase, to see what difficulties they arise? I have done this in my own projects, and most of the times I found it to be very useful, so I would really suggest this path.<br/><br/>If help and time effort is needed, I could try helping out with some code if you really are interested on improving it, although I am not the best coding with gtk...<br/><br/>BR",

I would say that 99% of the people using raw process their photos with a bit of sharpening and levels adjust. At least that's what most other raw processors include in their defaults.<br/><br/>About the custom toolbar,  yes, I was referring to the favourites one (the star). The problem is that I have too many tools in it, all the ones I use frequently and are hidden in other toolbars. So I find myself in need to reduce them or split them in sections.<br/><br/>you're correct about the file manager. It's due to my own workflow: unfortunately often I find myself processing straight from external USB/CF drives whose content varies, or using a laptop when I travel where contents are temporary while I reach my desktop... so the folder structure changes... adding them to the darktable database just doesn't make much sense to me, but it's just getting used to it.<br/><br/>Thanks for the responses",

But currently we are still very much a GTK2 project.<br/><br/>The Unity integration is a very simple library, which is easy to enable/disable (and it's disabled by default in all builds), and has next to to impact on anything.<br/><br/>The GNOME3.10 close button probably depends on using a recent version of GTK3. So considering our GTK3 cleanup effort isn't finished, and we're not building against it, it's unlikely to be an option in practical terms.<br/><br/>Once our code is GTK3 clean, and we start building against GTK3 by default, we may reconsider something like this.

I've just adopted it after having evaluated 10 or more alternative, it's the best free alternative application I found to manage raw files<br/><br/>I really appreciate the quality of the software, reliable, powerfull and smart<br/><br/>Besides frequently updated with improvement (local correction coming soon !) Great Job !<br/><br/>The only remark if I may, would be on the user interface, I see still room for improvement there. Some ideas I would like to see implemented:<br/><br/>- Cursors are too small in parameter bars (inducing waste in productivity), if it was slightly larger it would be easier and so quicker to adjust values. An idea also could be to change the appearance of the cursor when it has been changed from it original position (ex plain or outlined)<br/><br/>- Be able to modify module order in groups (or at least in favorite group) by grag and drop (or preference settings). I read somewhere it’s in the order the engine apply the filters but it would be so usefull to match with the user workflow.<br/><br/>- Preference &amp; Settings menu would need to be revamped, I’m not convinced all options are really needed, I missed some ergonomic options (ex fontsize) and “photo development” options. Take no offence but I have the feeling this menu has been developed by and for software developers than Photographer (fyi I'm a software engineer, photo is my hobby ...)<br/><br/>- Whereas it’s possible to adjust the size of the left and right side panels in the parameter menu, I would have prefer to be able to adjust it dynamically<br/><br/>As a conclusion, really good soft, very powerfull and well designed (I can feel the developers technical expertise), but imho it will definitely catch (and overclass !) non-free solutions if it was a little bit more user centered",

That's the opposite of what the quoted \"Cinematic Color\" paper suggests.<br/><br/>I pointed this out several times on the list. To really make DT a linear image processing tool, you need to disable the basecurve completely and apply it, at the end of the pipe, by other means (because there is no way to reorder the modules in DT, for the user, at this time).",

However, it was deprecated in some newer 1.2 releases already, so you probably can only see it with 1.2 or older but not with 1.2.1 and newer.<br/><br/>Deprecating a module doesn't mean that it stops working in darktable, it just means that it won't be usable for new images any longer. Images that already make use of these modules should keep working, since we still ship the deprecated modules.<br/><br/>I am not aware of a way to collect all the images that make use of such a module. And there is not automatic way to switch over to the new one. If there was we would have taken care of that for you automatically.",

      "comment" : "Unlike many other programs, Darktable (as it should!) embeds a proper ICCv2 color profile into JPEGs it exports.<br/><br/>EOG enables display color management depending on the input file it receives, if it finds an embedded color profile or certain EXIF tags, it enables display color management (which is sortof a bug in EOG, display color management should either always be applied, or it shouldn't, it's the dynamic behavior that confuses people). But I'm guessing in your particular situation EOG is actually doing the right thing.<br/><br/>What is likely happening is that you have a bad display profile setup. The following two articles may assist you into further troubleshooting your issue:<br/><br/>https://encrypted.pcode.nl/blog/2012/01/29/color-management-on-linux/<br/>https://encrypted.pcode.nl/blog/2013/04/14/display-profiles-generated-from-edid/<br/><br/>The PNG works as you expect (even though those expectations may not be correct) because for that format darktable doesn't support ICC profiles to be embedded yet (IIRC). EXIF in PNG is non-standard too (IIRC). PNG really isn't a great format for photography purposes.",

IMHO the features of the app are far beyond many commercial existing applications, but tends to be very quirky and slow from the average user's point of view.<br/><br/>As an ex Bibble/Aftershot (and also Lightzone) user, I would be willing to pay a good annual subscription fee even, for this software and thus fund your coding and meetings. But (no offense meant honestly) current coders seem to be more intrsted and focused on new features than usability, while the general complaint about the software is about the second.<br/><br/>Not only me, many have been left out by Corel and are in the same situation as me (just read their forums and comments on darktable). We have new cameras, all unsupported by Aftershot. And darktable is the only software powerful enough to replace it, just that it's too hard to use when processing hundreds of photos in one go.<br/><br/>I hope you consider this.

With a simple ctrl+C+V I can copy the same setting to 20 similar photos.

There was no confirmation page after I signed up, and no notification e-mail so far either.

I installed Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 over the weekend and installed the latest Darktable from the repositories (your own PPA not having an updated version yet).<br/><br/>When I run \"darktable -d opencl\", I get:<br/><br/>[opencl_init] trying to load opencl library: ''<br/>[opencl_init] opencl library 'libOpenCL' found on your system and loaded<br/>[opencl_init] FINALLY: opencl is NOT AVAILABLE on this system.<br/>[opencl_init] initial status of opencl enabled flag is OFF.<br/><br/>(I'll double-check to make sure this is the actual complete message when I get home from work this afternoon.)<br/><br/>Used to be fine in 13.10. System:<br/><br/>Ubuntu Gnome 14.04<br/>64 bit<br/>NVidia driver 331<br/>Darktable 1.4.1 from Ubuntu's repositories<br/><br/>Hope you can help me out with this!

Importing from camera or card doesn't works on release for Mac 1.4.2  and 1.5.1 , trying with Canon Eos 650D and 2 different SD cards Kingston and Sandisk. The devices are visible or mounted in the Finder, but DT can´t detect it.<br/><br/>2. Ungroup lateral and central panels to move some to a 2nd display.<br/><br/>3. Change font size proportionally to the width of panels, when you change this in preferences, so nothing is hidden.<br/><br/>4. On candidate for Mac 1.5.1, some fonts size (tags 4 ex.) and icons (presets and reset) are smaller than on release for Mac 1.4.2.<br/><br/>Even so, i´m going to keep enjoying with DT and more in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks.",

And it's also very dependant on how well this detection process works. We have an automatic CA correction plugin as well, and that's a hit and miss affair. Non-parameterized approaches tend to not be too reliable.<br/><br/>Lensfun (given good calibration data) is quite reliable and more importantly contributed lens data, will not just benefit Darktable, but also UFRaw, RawStudio, Hugin, GIMP and Digikam.<br/><br/>So I think Lensfun is the right approach to begin with. It's just sad so few people contribute lens data.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, through efforts of Thorsten Bronger, there has been an uptake in new lens data recently:<br/>http://www.darktable.org/2013/07/have-your-lens-calibrated/",

However, I cannot find any explanation of how adjust the size of the font. Starting Darktable from the command line with -d control shows it is setting the screen resolution to 59.000001 dpi. In darktablerc the screen_dpi_overwrite setting = -1.0. Can anyone explain to what I should change the overwrite setting to create larger fonts in the GUI so that I can read it? TIA",

Now i pumped that up to 3000x3000 (you suggested is a maximum) and it's not cutting the image anymore on my display which is 2880x1800. I have reverted screen_ppd_overwrite to -1.0  I believe many people will experience the same issue (I did't even know this setting is there - and I'm still thinking it works in a wrong way. So default is 1300x1000 (which is pretty small by todays display standards) so on those defaults if I choose 'fit to screen' it cuts pixels from the width and height rather than fitting the image into this predefined image drawing area. I also see that image is shown as I scroll, but after i stop scrolling it just cuts pixels and you see only a part of the image. To me that is a bug because it's supposed to 'fit' the image into those 1300x1000 not crop the image. <br/><br/>Everything else looks really good. Thank you for all the hard work!",

However, could you also please follow it up with an article (or YouTube video?) on how to USE these luminosity masks with a photo in Darktable to help improve it?  <br/><br/>I've been reading up for a while about this Luminosity Mask method, and have yet to use it in anger (maybe next week I'll give it a go in Gimp) but the main thing is that articles online about Luminosity Masks (either in Adobe products or in Gimp) usually show it as a way to subtly improve multiple exposures of photos as layers by blending them once masked and adjusted.  I suspect that this can't be done in Darktable due to not having the ability to load multiple photos into one 'shot' to manipulate.  However, would something similar be possible using a single photo with multiple 'instances' of masks?  <br/><br/>I'm just unsure of how best to make use of your excellent article.  Any further advice would be of great interest to us all, I'm sure.  Thank you.",

Move this files into extra packages, that can be released independent from from exiv2.<br/><br/>3. With this changes it would be possible to create a website where everyone can upload an image. The EXIV information is read and the user can enter the name of the lens. This information get saved into the lens information file and can be released in the next version of this file. The user could even directly download the file and save it in the right folder and benefit immediately.<br/><br/>4. darktable could add a function to click on an unknown lens, enter the name and save it locally into the lens information file.

Also that the caching code was going to be reworked to make it faster in a later version.<br/>Is it worthwhile for me to try helping debug the current problem or is it the plan to just hope to fix it with new code (which I am assuming is Feature #10500, planned for 2.0)?",

Compiler (there is no one standard exception handling for example, so you have to make sure that every C++ based code you link to uses the same as you do), libraries (most external libs we depend on would have to be built and manually updated forever) and deployment (we would have to waste time with an installer since there is no universal package management we can rely on – this is related to the other points). So in the end it's all a big burden and extra work for most likely nothing in return. And as long as all of this is a hobby the motivating factor for us to work on darktable is FUN.

I even managed to build DarkTable using Premake and the Express Visual Studio edition. I had to do a lot of horrible stuff and deactivate a lot of functionalities, and even though it just crashed on launched. That's when I decided to just leave this be.<br/><br/>You'll have to take my word for this, but I'm a professional developper. I work in video games, and I have \"quite a bit\" of knowledge and experience in multiplatform and architectures (win, macos, ios, android (all the flavors) ps3/4, xbox, and some other esoteric platforms) When I say that your codebase is a nightmare, ask yourself this question: how much work would it be required to port your application to Qt for instance ? Is it even feasible ? You might feel comfortable working in dt, but it doesn't mean it's clean. And this is where a lot of problems occur when trying to do multiplatform (well, you're not trying to, so it might explain things)<br/><br/>That being said, and having built it, I know that all the libs that dt is using is the cause of most of the problems. And I know that you won't bother with Windows builds and stuff. I probably shouldn't have talked about that in the first place and should just have said that you probably should be a little less (you being the community, not \"you\" necessarily) disrespectfull toward Windows (users). Because some like me will still continue to go here, at least to keep their old linux machine up to date with the latest Dt release. And it's just sad that everytime I do and make the mistake of reading the comments, I feel \"persona non grata\"<br/><br/>Finally, just a request: please remove the Windows section on the installation page of this site. It's just insulting/trolling. It will does nothing for you, except saddening people like me.",

I very much like Darktable RAW processing, alas I understand that a version for the former is highly unlikely due to technical reasons cited by Darktable programmers. That is fine; for Windows I have Lightroom and Rawtherapee. I haven't any complaints with using either.<br/>But I have to side with those taking exception to the wording on your \"Install\" webpage: it it perfectly understandable that there be notice Darktable isn't available for Microsoft Windows (after all, it is the most prevalent computer operating system in the world today, and some may just be assuming you've got it covered). But suffice it to say one is not available, as there is absolutely no need to communicate that fact so pejoratively towards Windows users on your site. And it is especially hypocritical to be so snide towards that \"commercial distro\" when Darktable is fully supported on MacOS X, probably the most commercial and insular OS on Earth (it's not only closed-source, but you are restricted to running it on Apple's own over-priced hardware). Your language is thus unfair and divisive. As such, I suggest the wording under the Windows section either be changed, or the name of the OS be removed completely from your website.",

But only few of those potential developers might be able to take on the task of porting unfamiliar software to their operating system, though they could contribute in other areas (e.g. camera support, translation, etc.), thus improving the software and maybe starting a positive feedback cycle (better software -&gt; more users -&gt; more developers -&gt; better software).<br/><br/>I agree that no FLOSS developer has any obligation whatsoever to implement a specific functionality in his spare time. But maybe you could provide a blog post/wiki page/whatever that you can point the Windows users to that says something like \"You want darktable to support Windows? Great! These are things you'd need to implement and if you hit any problems, these are the people that you can ask for advice.\" That might actually lower the bar far enough for someone to stand up and do the work.",

Did you create anything similar as the files in darktable-release-1.6.7\\cmake\\macosx for Windows?<br/>- houz: Where do you see the major effort in maintaining the build? If building is trivial, how much more does it take to regularly perform the build once a new source version is released? Once you have a build setup, this should also be trivial. In fact, this could be automated fairly simply. Same goes for releasing the build artifacts.<br/><br/>Maybe we could do this together. I am interested.",

      "comment" : "@ Mashall Stack:<br/>I have been reading the Heise comments in the last few days with mild amusement, so many wrong claims, wild theories (and the usual Heise comment crap on top – you are not meant). I wonder why no one approached us (or me in particular, as my name was mentioned a few times in these comments) in IRC yet. Anyway, let's answer here as I couldn't be bothered to register at the Heise forums.<br/><br/>I cross compiled my Windows version under Linux, using MinGW. All the steps I took several years ago when I did this the first time are well documented in git (I wonder if anyone poking around there ever actually looked at the code checkout? He might have found it), and my recent endeavour took basically the same route just with some small differences and updates that I will document soonish, too.<br/><br/>Now I happen to know that you are using the Microsoft compiler and can already tell you: forget it. That won't work and is a waste of your time. Microsoft didn't manage to support a C standard from the last millennium (C99) which darktable makes use of, so their compilers are useless for the job at hand. If you need any more information: Come to IRC, #darktable on FreeNode.<br/><br/>Regarding the 2nd half of your question: Maintaining a port is not the same as packaging it. That can indeed be done by a script and a cron job. Maintaining means knowing the platform with closed eyes, seeing a bug report and immediately being able to do an educated guess what causes it and knowing how to fix it in hours. The kind of proficiency we request from ourselves and that makes darktable a viable software under Linux. We can't let a half hearted Windows port stand in the way of the reputation we built. So if you want to do that: great. But be prepared to donate most of your free time in the years to come and better be able to manage to compile darktable or I doubt that you would be able to fix what's broken.",

      "comment" : "I love darktable, being a Linux user and a hobbyist photographer Darktable is the perfect match for me.<br/><br/>I must admit though that the Darktable project, in comparison with other FLOSS projects, is much \"closer\", not in the code or licensing sense of the word, in the social sense. For example I never find a comfortable way of knowing where Darktable's next version is heading, what are their priorities, what they are working on etc. I suppose I could just check the code repository from time to time or subscribe to the development mailing list or something like that, but in comparison with other open source projects this is a little bit more obscure.<br/><br/>I suspect the reason for this is exactly the same as the reason explained here for not having a Windows version. They just aren't interested at all at creating a huge community, they just want to have fun doing what their curiosity asks them to do. Luckily they are kind enough to let us enjoy their work, they could just decide to do it in a private way and keep the software for them, that way they wouldn't have to invest time in giving explanations about anything to anyone.<br/><br/>I would love to see the Darktable community grow and open a little more but this does not usually come by free, that means having someone investing even  more time in community management tasks, attending the questions and problems of even more people and requesting people who are working for free to accept the obligation of doing not exactly what they feel like doing in the moment but what was agreed and \"promised\" to the community.<br/><br/>I agree with the fact that a bigger user community might attract a bigger developer community but IMHO I doubt the ratio between new users with new problems and the new developers with new solutions would compensate, not at least until the community was really powerful enough. <br/><br/>Unless the main development team is willing to commit to growing the community to such point I think we must be happy and grateful with what they are already giving us.<br/><br/>By the way I think a way of donating to the project is a fantastic idea.<br/><br/>Thanks for the great work!<br/><br/>Maybe",

Meanwhile I deleted the account at the forum and I also had a closer look into the translations. I quickly recognized that this translation will take months and that my language skills not sufficient. Much more this translations must be keep updated!<br/><br/>darktable is highly optimized to delivery a responsive UI. Who will take care that this will also be the case on Windows. Have you ever tried the Windows-Build of digikam?<br/><br/>Please listen to the answers of houz, because he simple knows and do not underestimated the work related to user requests which will arise once a Windows-Build will be official. Do know how many 3rd party software has problems with the current Windows 10 release? Many users will take it to safe a view bucks on commercial products, but expect the same features and so on.<br/><br/>What I do not want to see is that darktable development and performance will suffer, because developers need to take care on Windows specific issues.<br/><br/>By the way you can donate in some way, because developers usually ask for donations for the libre graphic meetings: http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2015/",

      "comment" : "Dear darktable team,<br/><br/>you are doing an awesome job. I have been a serious amateur photographer for a very long time. There are a couple of reasons I switched to Linux, job related and also the FLOSS idea. For a long time I was holding back to switch to linux, since I didn't see any suitable raw-processing software to  pursue my favourite hobby: photography. When I discovered darktable, I finally did the move to switch on my private machine to Linux. Thanks for that.<br/>I have expirienced darktable almost on par with some of the best commercial software that I used before. In some respects darktable is a lot better and has features I hadn't seen before, but on the other side I also miss much polishing and stability. So naturally I thought I could donate some money to get things developing faster and to get myself a better user expierence. It is for me the only way to really to contribute. My job involves computer work every day with overtime. I have family and other obligations. I can't spend my last couple of hours of freetime learning to program, which I tried a couple of times, but found that it just isn't for me. I am also not a person who likes to spend the evening in some bug tracker board to triag stuff. But, I wouldn't mind throwing in some cash to advance the project. If someone else likes to hack on darktable and I can provide some money to enable that person to spend time doing this, or pay his trips to conferences or pay a new server, then I am absolutly willing to contribute that money. In the same way I used to pay for prioritary software. <br/><br/>I understand that organizing this takes time: creating a legal entity, budgeting, taxes, community feedback,... but I think it would be well spend efforts.<br/>I like the example of krita. They manage to finance 1.5 full-time positions and I honestly believe that darktable does have the potential to do even better. With adobe, google(NIK) and others that provide serious photography tools moving into the cloud, I think it will become more and more important to have a serious alternative for the linux desktop (and other OSs).<br/><br/>I think that there would be many plus sides for you guys to do that step and the downsides should not be that many. Maybe you could have a chat with the krita guys and see what their experience is and then reevaluate. I think the community would definitely make donations in return for more stability and polishing here and there, but also to show you guys appreciation.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Matt",

      "comment" : "Respect for those who are involved in this program. I was a Apple user and turned back to windows pure the fact that Apple is sick of pricing there products that the choice is simple when you want to have a fast notebook with a BIG GPU in it. ASUS ROG G751 rocks ;). I hope there will be some one in the world who want to maintain Darktable for windows. Now working a couple months with Rawtherapee great  program but it's less on features/tools then DT. Missing tools really. To bad I am a designer with opensource care, if I am a developer programmer then I know what my mission will be -- maintainer",

If you didn't use any new features in the processing of your images (which 1.6.8 wouldn't know) it should be safe to remove ~/.config/darktable/library.db and just reimport your raw files.

      "comment" : "paraffin, thanks for you quick reply. However I still seem to be too stupid to make darktable work on my MacBook Air. Panel width it set to 350, decreasing it (e.g. 340) does not help. The setting screen_dpi_overwrite seems to be an invalid/unknown as it is deleted from darktablerc directly after running the app.<br/>I was finally changing the language to English and actually that makes a difference. So that seems to be my only option at the moment. <br/>Maybe it's a GTK 3.0 issue but resizing the app window generally seems to be a problem. I see different uncommon/weird behavior when maximizing the window and/or running it fullscreen. The later does not work at all for me as the menu bar is indeed hidden, but the space release isn't used be the app (same for the dock). <br/><br/>I would give 2.0 a try on my iMac (21\" with 1680x1050) but that's an old one still running 10.7.5. Darktable directly crashes because of an incompatibility with cups (at least that's what I understand from the crash report).<br/><br/>As this is probably the wrong place to discuss my problem, should I redirect it to the mailing list?",

I talk about the mode in lighttable described on your website with: \"ctrl-z  fully zoom into the image and show areas in focus \"<br/><br/>The function I would appreciate to see is<br/>- hit any key combination<br/>- have the zoom mode with shown focus areas persistent<br/>- navigate with arrows through the pictures (perhaps you could scroll through the pictures with the mouse wheel too)<br/>- use delete button to delete/move to trash the shown picture (perhaps you could map mouse wheel click to delete the shown picture)<br/>- optionally provide strg+z to undo the deletion/move to trash<br/><br/>If the function works with the mouse support it would be very easy to sort the best picture out of a set of pictures.<br/><br/>If darktable could provide these function it would speed up the workflow of many fotographers I think.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Tobias",

Looking at the EXIF info in \"image information\" in Darktable, the date seems to be correct. Also, the ~ sign no longer translates to the home directory as i believe it did before, but rather creates a \"~\" directory in the home folder. $(HOME) works properly though.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.",

      "comment" : "Thanks a lot for this new release !<br/><br/>I just installed on xubuntu thanks to Pascal de Bruijn ppa. It works like a charm.<br/>One question though, regarding the lensfun usage.<br/><br/>The ppa does not provide lensfun package anymore, but the lens correction plugin seems to work without it, and darktable already have a lensfun database installed (I don't think I had lensfun installed previously).<br/><br/>I tried to update lensfun and lensfun database by installing the 3.2 version from lensfun website. I installed lensfun 3.2 with Cmake, and I replaced the lensfun .xml in /usr/share/lensfun with the updated ones. The new lensfun database format version 1 [0] seems to be not usable by darktable.<br/><br/>Replacing the lensfun xml header from  to  allows Darktable to read the database, and I can applied correction for a SLR (nikon D2X) + lens (nikkor 18-200mm vr I).<br/><br/>This workaround does not work for my compact Sony RX100 mII. The camera is recognized, but the lens is not.<br/><br/>Looking at the xml syntax in compact-sony.xml shows some evolution between database version 0 and 1.<br/><br/>Is there any other solution at that time than manually modifying the xml files to fit the syntax to the database version 0 of lensfun (darktable 2.0 compilation with lensfun 3.2) ?<br/><br/>Last question, I have a noise profile for D2X ready to ship, where do I need to send it ?<br/><br/>Happy new year 2016 !<br/><br/>[0] http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/manual/db_versions.html",

That cost me about $100, which I think is worth it in terms of time saved in the short term.  However, Lr 6 will soon be ruthlessly obsoleted I am sure, and so I'll be installing and playing with darktable in parallel, so that I have a real community supported open source solution for the longer term.<br/><br/>BTW, Apple has egg all over face the last couple of years imho -- migration (forced by Apple) from Aperture to Photos seems to be impossible for many users with large photo libraries (myself included).  I have spent a couple of days now trying it, total failure;  results from others who have taken the issue up through levels of Apple Support are very discouraging.  What a PR fiasco.  Looks like Apple has made a strategy call to go for the consumer market and abandon the media professionals (at least the photographers).<br/><br/>So... I am very, very glad that the darktable project is rolling and hope I can contribute something useful along the way.

I upgraded from Fedora 21 to 23 only to be able to build DT 2.0.0 recently, and you gave us even newer version so quickly!<br/><br/>I think that it would be very useful to have the newest darktable in official fedora update repository. For some strange (and unknown to me) reason they still stay on v1.6.9. Is there any way how to help to propagate the newer version into repos? Eg. post somewhere a user report with my system info, or something alike?",

There is a guy who has developed command-line software called Kalpanika that converts Foveon X3F files into DNG. His name is Roland Karlsson and can be contacted here: http://www.dpreview.com/members/6000522696/overview .<br/><br/>Would it make any sense if you and he worked together to allow DT to process X3F files into DNG that can be viewed and handled normally within DT? It would make a lot of sense to me as a DT and Sigma user! His Kalpanika project, basically a family effort, ran out of energy with a couple of issues still needing work. And the lack of a GUI is limiting. A bit of combined programmer horsepower for a mutual outcome, one that benefits marginalised Sigma camera users who, like Linux users, are not in the mainstream and need a little help from others. :) Sigma camera users are stuck with Sigma PhotoPro raw processor, which has numerous disadvantages.<br/><br/>thanks for reading this far (I hope)",

      "comment" : "I think what the developers did with the April Fools prank was something very valuable in the sense of making us (users and devs) a bit closer in a way, something like an ice-breaker. I'm amazed how people respond to something like this with so much negativity. You expect them to be \"more professional\" and feel that it discredits a project? What do you mean by that? Today I saw a prank on Facebook from a commercial software I use for pro-audio, \"Mixbus\", which I do pay money for, and it's not any ordinary program, they even create consoles from way back 60's or 70's and ABBA, Queen, Michael Jackson have been recorded in these consoles. This is an enterprise  company and they pulled a prank today:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/HarrisonMixbus/posts/10156693462480153<br/><br/>What is wrong with that? I think it's great! When I saw the game in DT late last night it brought a smile to my face, and I played it with joy, I'm sure developers were expecting that response from everyone, I guess not everyone has a sense of humor, so sad...<br/><br/>Thanks DT developers for your hard work and for your humanity...<br/><br/>Cheers!",

      "comment" : "Hi, everyone. I did check the code from a git and colorchart.c has some minor problems to read some .cht files. I have been using customized spyderchecker cht files for spyderchecker color charts, ( check: http://goo.gl/w7OQ3L ) but i think this quick fix apllies to some other .cht files also.<br/><br/>Here's steps i need for myself:<br/>1 st. Take all empty lines away from a blocks (BOXES... etc..)<br/>2 nd. Make sure the lines do not start with tab stops, if they do replace them as spaces.<br/>3.rd Hard part is to get grey patches visible to the combo box. if grey patches do not have own X or Y line writeen to .cht file you have to add new line and calculate this yourself.<br/><br/>Before my custom .cht file BOXES section was like this:<br/>BOXES 49<br/>  F _ _ 62 49 1684 49 1684 1187 62 1187<br/> <br/>  D ALL ALL _ _ 1684 1187 0 0 0 0<br/><br/> X  A D 1 6  161 161    62  49  195  195<br/> X  E H 1 6  161 161    935  49  195  195<br/><br/>After a fix:<br/>BOXES 49<br/> F _ _ 62 49 1684 49 1684 1187 62 1187<br/> D ALL ALL _ _ 1684 1187 0 0 0 0<br/> X  A C 1 6  161 161    62  49  195  195<br/> X  D E 1 6  161 161    647 49  288  195<br/> X  F H 1 6  161 161    1130  49  195  195<br/><br/>Now i'm able to see D1-E6 in a combo box and darktable-chart do not have any problems to read it.<br/><br/>tab stops and empty lines is easy to fix to the code but i think gray ramp combobox should be replaced to simple input line because some cht files do not have own area calculated for a gray patches. It's much user friendly just write ie. D1-E6 to input line than calculate area and modify cht file. Like in a SpyderChecker cht file gray patches are on a middle of all other patches.<br/><br/>I hope this helps somehow users and dt developers.",

      "comment" : "Just to thank you so much for devoloping this fantastic software. As a heavy linux user an photo enthusiast I searched for an appropriate solution for editing Canon EOS and samsung NX raw files in Linux OS. <br/><br/>All my stuff is recognized with Darktable out of the box (which is not with Adobe lightroom or Canon DDP!). In the Adobe case you have to buy a software upgrade for a lot of money to get the same support you get with Darktable. Canon DDP is for free, but has far weaker options than darktable and is just linked to the manufacturer. <br/><br/>Darktable 2.0.5 runs perfect under Linux Fedora. Just acitvate rpm fusion for the latest releases. In Ubuntu/Mint an old version is in the sources out of the box. So getting the darktable source key is a good idea. <br/><br/>I even experienced a lot of advantages in comparison to lightroom (besides the fact that Darktable is for free):<br/><br/>- nearly all new camera bodies are supported, if you install the latest version. I.E. my Samsung NX3000 is supported in Darktable, but not so in Lightroom 4)<br/>- the workflow is even better in some areas. Its easier to get a picture in a landscape or portrait format which is needed very often.<br/>- because Linux runs faster, consuming less resources on my machines, darktable is running faster and more stable than lightroom as well. So if you don't have extremely powerful machines for example business laptops with a Linux OS and Darktable are by far the better option.   <br/>- Darktable images get a little darker than lightroom images. In most cases darker images look more appealing. Many manufacturers especially Canon create at least in full automatic mode a little overexposed.<br/>- look at the size of the packages. Lightroom is consuming a lot of space on your machine. Darktable doesn't. With ten times less file space you get the same results.<br/><br/>Besides Adobe lightroom via wine installation there are no alternatives to Darktable in Linux. Rawtherapee is not easy to use, Digikam takes a lot of time to load and process pictures. But for some special issues Gimp in Linux is a creat tool. Installing Darktable and Gimp you can't go wrong.",

On a 27\" Retina iMac with 10.9.5 they are so small, that it is nearly impossible to use them (thats why I use normally the numerical entering). The size of the triangles seem to appear with aprox. a millimeter. Everything else - fontsize etc. is rendered correctly, also the highlighting of entrys is better now.<br/><br/>There is also a problem with the mouse focus on rightclick context menus that gets sometimes lost. Then it is only possible to make a selection by arrowkeys.<br/><br/>And: Is there a \"feature request\" list somewhere?

      "comment" : "Hi!<br/><br/>(Sorry, my English is very poor.)<br/><br/><br/>I think this method will never replacing an real enfused LDR from exp.bracketed image series, but very interesting idea. I'm using too sometimes in Gimp with composite layers.<br/><br/>I tested this upcoming future some heavily underexposed raw files from Nikon D90, D7000 and D800 with camera default base curves shipped by Darktable and linear base curves + extracted Nikon ICC input profiles with gamma correction. Images are back- or sidelight landscapes and backlight indoor scenes in various ISO.<br/><br/>The +3+6EV settings is totally unusable for this cameras, but the only +3EV is nice in first look. +3+6EV is making very ugly halo effect and overexposed high tones. Of course, in +3EV mode the noise level is increased in the recovered deep shadow areas. The noise is very high in homogeneous part like blue sky - but easily kill with masked noise filters. Apart from this the overall result have natural tones, nice look for human eye.<br/><br/>Nikon D90 have the worst result with unacceptable high level noise especially over ISO400. D800 is the best - maybe thanks for the more higher resolution. All time the week point if the scene have high contrast areas, example Sun behind mountain peek. In this case I have got some ugly dark and bright halo around border of the very bright and very dark parts - in +3EV mode too. <br/><br/>Yes I know this is an experimental project, but maybe this feature need an independent module in the \"Tone group\" named \"Enfuse\" or \"Fake HDR\". It will been very usable with more adjustable parameters like weight of expo, contrast, saturation, etc. what comes from Enfuse. And it's highly usable with masks! The only three option \"none\" \"+3EV\" +3EV+6EV\" is very poor.<br/><br/>I think in the actual state this feature is incapable for fine prints, but sometimes usable to processing content-weighted art photos, were the overall image quality is not the primary consideration.<br/><br/>Darktable is my only RAW processing tool from ver 1.1RC and I'm very curious as to where You would develop the latest upcoming future. Thx for the works!",

So far, I usually boosted about 3 EV in steps of 0.5 EV.

      "comment" : "Please take a look for Your sample picture. http://www.darktable.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/img_0009.jpg<br/>The bush on the left side is very interesting ;)<br/><br/>I make some test meantime. The strong aura is visible if the base curve is linear.<br/><br/>The Darktable make wrong colors with the default settings: some colors have irrational saturation and hue especially in the light shadows, and skin tones is very-very far from the natural look too. So I'm using the most of time Nikon Picture Control icms as input color profile. In this case I don't need adjust the base curve because it is defined in the icm - I must set the base curve to linear in the iop. Otherwise I have too many contrast. But if I use camera-match base curves in the  iop with standard or enhanced color matrix as input color profile I have any or really light auras.<br/><br/>There is a sample where the auras coming out with non-linear base curve too.<br/>http://www.dropbox.com/s/y39268lm5w2ag2s/dt_enfuse_test_NIKON_D7000.tar.gz?dl=0<br/><br/>This photo is in right exposure and I never want to take back the deep tones in the real life, but is good sample for the noise and the auras.<br/>Look the backdrop near the arm on the left side: there are unwanted shadows around the arm. This is fake. And You can see the bigger noise in the originally dark areas. Please note: this is ISO100, what is the native ISO setting in this camera.<br/><br/><br/>I'll really happy, that the stable release have more control of enfuse in the future. Please think about of the EV differences too. 0-3EV and 0-3-6EV is very wide in the most of case, it have too flat look for the overall image. 0-1, 0-2 and 0-1-2EV is perfect to bring back more details from the deep shadows. It's only +3 option. There are some scene where we don't want or can't taking exp. bracket HDR. Example if there are some moving object, the shutter speed is too slow in the overexposed shot, strong wind, etc. In this situations an underexposed pseudo-HDR maybe good way to taking great photos.<br/><br/><br/>If You need same D90 D7000 and D800 raw files please send me an e-mail. Nikon revers some rights of the PC icm, so I don't want to share in a blogpost comment.<br/><br/>Have a nice night!",

      "comment" : "Thanks! I recently processed hundreds of my vacation photos on my 5k imac with 2.0.6. A few glitches here and there but no showstoppers and I'm very happy with Darktable at this point.<br/><br/>Some constructive criticism (mostly I would expect known issues but you never know):<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have at this point is simple ux: a lot of the ui elements are tiny and hard to grab with a mouse. I've seen people struggle with this in various youtube tutorials. E.g. most sliders are painful and especially on parametric masks this is very fiddly. Also, I think this UI would be downright painful with a touch screen in its current form for the same reason.<br/><br/>I know there is an open issue for undo. I've on multiple occasions lost changes by messing with the history. One wrong move there and your changes are gone. There is no undo. <br/><br/>Creating new instances of filters is a nice feature but it would be nicer still if we could rename them. I'm sure this is somewhere in the issue tracker already. The way the filters reorder or duplicate themselves when you edit or create new instances is a bit confusing. I've had issues with the filter view switching to the wrong column when creating new instances of filters. This is somewhat confusing as well but after it happened a couple of times I knew where too look.<br/><br/>I've had issues with crop &amp; resize where my attempts to grab one of the edges becomes a \"move the rectangle\" or doesn't work at all. The latter goes away if I switch the image to full screen with the tab button. I think this is another case of too small click targets. Also it's sometimes hard to get it back to the edit mode when you've confirmed the change. I work around this by right clicking the angle slider, which seems to do the trick.",

      "comment" : "1. Yes and no. It will update your library.db and copy over all tags, presets and styles found into the new data.db. Then it will drop styles and presets from the library. It will however keep all tags in the library, too. The reason being that the library should contain all data for your images so that you could move it to another computer or back it up somewhere. Thus the tags need to be in there, too. However, only the tags used for the images in the library are added to the library. Not all tags known to data.db.<br/>On startup darktable will import all tags available in the loaded library into data.db so that you won't lose anything. If you use an old library that still got styles or presets while there is an existing data.db (for example because you copied back an old library, or you are exchanging them between computer, …) then dt will also import the styles and presets from that library, renaming them if there is a name clash, and then update the old library as mentioned before.<br/><br/>2. Funny that you mention MIDI: that's something I intend to work on in the near future. At the moment you can't make use of it though – unless you find some external program that reads MIDI events and generates keyboard sequences, then you could try to interface it to the shortcuts in darktable. But I never tried that.",

In fact, the only reason why ARMv8 is required, is because it is the first ARM that is 64 bit.<br/>For darktable, 32-bit support is deeply troubled, soft-deprecated, and we certainly do <strong>not</strong> want to support any new 32-bit hardware.<br/><br/>You can however build+run darktable on <a href=\"https://www.darktable.org/2016/04/running-on-non-x86-platforms/\">Raspberry Pi</a>, on ARMv7, and for that you just need to disable the checks in <a href=\"https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/master/src/is_supported_platform.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">src/is_supported_platform.h</a>.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that such configuration is not exactly supported by darktable when reporting issues that will definetly arise because of 32-bit.",

Also when switching from darkroom to lighttable (key L) and then back to darkroom (key B), suddenly another image is displayed - the one where the mouse was placed over in the lighttable.

      "comment" : "What's going on here is that the images are not scrolling when you change the star rating in the \"view\" dropdown.  You'll find that the image that you selected is still selected (make sure you're not mousing-over any image, and expand the \"image information\" on the left panel).<br/><br/>You can see this better if you zoom out a bit, select an image that has a high star rating, and then change the star rating in the view dropdown.<br/><br/>Seems to me it makes sense to scroll the images when you change the view dropdown so that the currently selected image is visible, at least when you're zoomed in all the way.  Whether it makes sense when you're zoomed out I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>Either way, the correct place to request a change is here:<br/><br/>https://redmine.darktable.org/projects/darktable/issues/new",

Other programs such as Fotomagico can  recognise the exported jpegs.<br/><br/>I've played around by readjusting the export values but it seems to make no difference.

I haven't tried all of the new features yet, but I have played with the color lookup table. I don't know exactly how it works yet, but its ability to modify colours is cool. It seems to work more locally somehow that the color zones tool. For example, in one image there was a beach with mostly warm tones, blue ocean, and a mostly grey, slightly blue sky.<br/><br/>As an experiment, I tried to make the sky more blue with the color zones tool, but in mainly affected the already blue ocean. However, when using the color lookup table, I could select the sky with the eyedropper, and changing the saturation slider to more saturated only increased the saturation of the sky. (I don't really advocate doing this to most pictures though!)<br/><br/>But the point is, it's an effect that was easy to accomplish using the LUT, but difficult with color zones. Neat.",

But then I get other error messages like:<br/><br/>\"the database lock file contains a pid that seems to be alive in your system: XXX\"<br/><br/> \"database version of `library.db' is too new for this build of darktable. aborting\"<br/><br/>Finally, the program never starts, and the process appears as \"zombi\" in the task list.<br/>The only way I had to make it work was to init my computer with kernel 4.4.0-58.  And now I'm on kernel 4.4.0-64 and I don't have this option anymore.<br/><br/>I'm clueless, and what worries me most is that I can't find any help on forums.  Seems nobody else has this problem.<br/><br/>This is why I'm writing to you with my clumsy english.  If you can give any help I'll be thankfull.",

Pretty nasty when this happens, as all the postprocessing is set back to zero.<br/>Not a big issue when you know about it, just a bit cumbersome (and this did not occur in former versions of Darktable).<br/>Nevertheless: Darktable is a great piece of software, the best available for any given system! Go on!<br/>Looking forward to getting support for the Fuji X-100 F, also!<br/>bests<br/>Markus",

The program is awesome and I want to thank you for that! I think, it is necessary to write a positive statement to show, that there is a big grateful community out there...<br/>And to all of you out there, who don't have any sense of humor or write only if there is a bug: How about to say - Thank you for that great free program!<br/><br/>Go on, Jürgen from Austria",
