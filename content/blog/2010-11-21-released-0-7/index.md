we released version 0.7 this weekend. some of the changes:

* .xmp is now used instead of .dt for sidecars
* libraw with dcraw 9.05
* plug-ins of darkroom mode are now in groups/tabs
* new darkroom plug-ins: zone system, relight, graduated neutral density, watermark
* changes can now be saved into named processing styles
* initial preferences dialog was added
* custom shooting settings can be added in tethering mode
* initial user manual was written, available in english, german, french, dutch, and swedish
* moved to xdg config file standard
* languages: ca cs de es fi fr gl it nl pl ru sq sv
* reset labels: double click the label to only reset this option, not the whole plug-in
* a cropped image can now be recropped without resetting the whole plug-in (press backspace)
* lots of new cameras with enhanced support (input profiles and base curves)
* recursive image import
* 962 commits since release-0.6 :)

again thanks for the great support from all our contributors (see about dialog, press on darktable version number in gui), and stay tuned for 0.8 to come soon, with a lot more features!
