We're proud to announce the new corrective release of darktable, 4.4.1!

When updating from the stable 4.2.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.2.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

for more information on how to contribute._

## Bug Fixes

- Fix inverted and corrupted grow/shrink in Liquify module.

- Fix FilmicRGB V7 CPU code path to disable the gamut mapping.

- Fix Negadoctor CPU code path where clipping was not properly computed.

- Fix snapshot label when containing non escaped characters.

- Fix possible crash on Windows when using mask in the Color Balance RGB
  module.

- Fix default value when editing the module's first instance name.

- Fix top history module being reset to default values when not using
  the auto module naming.

- Make sure OpenCL devices report at least v1. 2 support.

- Add some missing support for mask distortion to modules changing ROI
  (Region Of Interest) while processing.

- Fixed a spacing issue with text boxes in the metadata editor when
  one or more fields have been hidden by the user.

- Fix a bug in colorspace transformation OpenCL code leading to CPU
  fallback.

- Allow entering full preview mode when no image hovered or selected.

- Fix a case where no default auto-preset were applied to the
  image. If a user's auto-preset is created for a module we want to
  disable the default auto-preset only if the user's preset is
  actually applied (meaning the filter on camera, lens, iso, aperture
  or exposure matches).

## Lua

### API Version

- N/A

### Other Lua changes

- N/A

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be achieved by removing line 241 of the
  `darktable.css` file on your system. See
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166.

- Starting with this release a new support policy regarding macOS
  versions will be in place -- darktable releases will now only
  support those macOS versions that are also supported by Apple.
  Release 4.4 therefore drops support for macOS versions older than
  11.3.
