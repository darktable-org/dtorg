hi all,

as most of you probably noticed already, we published a point release, 1.4.1. the tarball is here:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.tar.xz/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.tar.xz/download)

make sure you check the signature:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.tar.xz.asc/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.tar.xz.asc/download)

the macintosh computer disk image with signature here:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.dmg/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.dmg/download)
[ https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.dmg.asc/download]( https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-1.4.1.dmg.asc/download)

this is just a point release, so not really any new features. detailed release notes are as follows:


* export: consistent names for output formats
* export to disk: overwrite file option
* grain plugin now allows smaller coarseness and will display coarseness values half of what they used to be, this is merely a cosmetic change, your images are unaffected.
* some masks related fixes
* some lua related fixes
* tiff writer (32bit float, little endian output, configurable compression)
* tiff reader
* subtly nicer scrollbar behavior
* theme loading cornercase fixups
* shadow & highlight module improvements (should be less prone to artifacts when used on new images)
* allow importing more than 1 style at a time
* regression was fixed when building darktable against bleeding edge glibc
* Sony A77V enhanced color matrix
* Nikon D5100 updated white balance presets
* Nikon 1 V2 noise profile (and by extension J3/AW1)
* Nikon 1 J1 noise profile (and by extension V1/J2/S1)
* Pentax K3 noise profile
* experimental support for Panasonic DMC-LF1 (we still need samples for the nonstandard aspect ratios)
* experimental support for SONY DSC-RX100M2
* experimental support for SONY NEX-3N
* still no Nikon D5300/D3300 support, we're still looking into that.

the darktable release plus ppa is being phased out:
