It is done, 1.0 is out. I sent out most of the new features with the announcement for 1.0rc2 a few weeks ago already, but for completeness, here it is again:

* New cameras supported
    *   Leica M9
    *   NX100/NX5/NX10/NX11
    *   Panasonic DMC-GX1
    *   Pentax K-r
    *   Canon Powershot S100
    *   Olympus XZ-1
    *   Olympus E-P3
    *   Sony DSLR A330
    *   Sony NEX-5N
    *   Canon EOS 1000D
    *   Canon EOS 600D
    *   Sony Alpha 390
    *   Fuji Finepix HS20EXR
* New and updated translations (we now have chinese!)
* New modules:
    *   shadows & highlights
    *   enhanced tone curve. now operates in a and b channels as well
* Refactored modules:
    *   import
    *   snapshots (enable sliding separation line between before/after images)
    *   metadata
* New image cache
    *   faster concurrent access and insertion
    *   reduces needed memory
    *   more thumbnails stored on disk
    *   read embedded jpegs for creating thumbnails (faster folder import)
* Increased general speed on sqlite3 (journaled, pagesize optimizations)
* Reworked, modular UI
* Keyboard shortcuts support&nbsp;â€“ key accelerators (GSoC)
* Unity launcher support (Ubuntu)
* Quicktool bar: exposure, presets and styles
* New color picker
* Web gallery export now with next/prev buttons per image
* Removed gconf: not used anymore, we have our own backend
* Bugfixes

Also, a couple of caveats to keep in mind this time:

* We don't support fuji superccd at this point (more or less a simple fix, if you want to do it, contact us ...)
* We disabled openmp by default for mac builds, as gcc on that platform seems to have some issues (<gcc 4.6, that is).
* We had to roll back libraw to <14.5, so the fuji X10 is not working at the moment.
* There have been issues with memory on 32-bit systems. seems to be okay currently, but something to keep in mind. use 64-bits if you can!

And as always a couple of links, just in case.

* Source tar.gz:

* Ubuntu Packages are readily available on Pascal's PPA, for Lucid, Natty, Oneiric and Precise. Support for Maverick has been fully deprecated.

    If you have 0.9.3 already installed and are upgrading using update-manager, it may ask about a partial upgrade, which should be ok (since we are rejecting the old darktable-plugins-experimental package).

* Pascal's screen casts (for the 0.9 series, but still valid):

And some advertising, we might be looking for students to take on GSoC this year:

And of course, huge thanks to all who helped make this possible! every half hour you can steal from your jobs and families makes a difference ;)

Also a darktable release announcement can't come without the warning that this version will soon be completely obsoleted feature-wise by the git version. We have some cool stuff sitting around in branches, waiting to be merged (spoiler: cleaner, more unified module UI with new widgets, similarity-based image clustering and search, refined conditional blend modes, maybe at some point geo tagging with map support in the center view, and possibly masking).

Have a lot of fun.
