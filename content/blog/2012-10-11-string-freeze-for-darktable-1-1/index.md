Yes.

As of today we are in string freeze for the next darktable version. Version 1.1 will not only contain bug fixes (that too) but a lot of new features. Some of them long-wanted, some of them you haven't even dreamed about.

As usual we follow our release procedure:

* String freeze (as of now). Translators get time to catch up and it's a good means to stop overly crazy development to be merged into master
* A couple of weeks of translating and bug hunting
* Then we'll release release candidates again, to enable bread testing even from users who aren't comfortable with "unstable" packages or git.
* ...&nbsp;and finally there will be a new stable version of darktable.

Please help us to make this release another success, translate if there is something to translate, test, find bugs and report them to our [bug tracker](https://darktable.org/redmine/projects/darktable/issues). If you have any questions, [join us on IRC or the mailing lists](/contact/).
