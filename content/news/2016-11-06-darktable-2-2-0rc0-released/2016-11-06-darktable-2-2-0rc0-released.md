and the changelog as compared to 2.0.0 can be found below.

* Well over 2 thousand commits since 2.0.0

## The Big Ones:

* Add new automatic perspective correction module ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-03-10-a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction/2016-03-10-a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction.md]({filename}/blog/2016-03-10-a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction/2016-03-10-a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction.md)")
* Liquify tool for all your fancy pixel moving ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-04-03-liquify-liquify/2016-04-03-liquify-liquify.md]({filename}/blog/2016-04-03-liquify-liquify/2016-04-03-liquify-liquify.md)")
* A new image module to use a Color Look Up Table (CLUT) to change colors in the image ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-05-24-colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module/2016-05-24-colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module.md]({filename}/blog/2016-05-24-colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module/2016-05-24-colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module.md)")
* In Highlight reconstruction module, the mode LCh reconstruction was completedy rewritten, and is no longer useless!
* A new tool, darktable-chart, that goes along with the CLUT module, to create styles for the corresponding module
* Exposure fusion in the basecurve module to lower the dynamic range of images ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-08-09-compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion/2016-08-09-compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion.md]({filename}/blog/2016-08-09-compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion/2016-08-09-compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion.md)")
* Add new raw overexposure indication ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-10-10-raw-overexposed/2016-10-10-raw-overexposed.md]({filename}/blog/2016-10-10-raw-overexposed/2016-10-10-raw-overexposed.md)")
* Darkroom: the preview (in top-left corner) is now no longer pre-demosaiced, thus the preview, color picker, histogram show the proper results when there is highlight clipping.
* Add undo/redo support for the darkroom

## Quite Interesting Changes:

* Split the database into a library containing images and a general one with styles, presets and tags. That allows having access to those when for example running with a :memory: library
* Support running on platforms other than x86 (64bit little-endian, currently ARM64 only) ("[{article.title}/blog/2016-04-01-running-on-non-x86-platforms/2016-04-01-running-on-non-x86-platforms.md]({filename}/blog/2016-04-01-running-on-non-x86-platforms/2016-04-01-running-on-non-x86-platforms.md)")
* darktable is now happy to use smaller stack sizes. That should allow using musl libc
* Allow darktable-cli to work on directories
* Allow to import/export tags from Lightroom keyword files
* Allow using modifier keys to modify the step for sliders and curves. Defaults: Ctrl&nbsp;– x0.1; Shift&nbsp;– x10
* Allow using the [keyboard] cursor keys to interact with sliders, comboboxes and curves; modifiers apply too
* Support presets in “more modules” so you can quickly switch between your favorite sets of modules shown in the GUI
* Add range operator and date compare to the collection module
* Support the Exif date and time when importing photos from camera
* Rudimentary CYGM and RGBE color filter array support
* Preview pipe now does run demosaic module too, and its input is no longer pre-demosaiced, but is just downscaled without demosaicing it at the same time.
* Nicer web gallery exporter&nbsp;– now touch friendly!
* OpenCL implementation of VNG/VNG4 demosaicing methods
* OpenCL implementation of Markesteijn demosaicing method for X-Trans sensors
* Filter-out some useless EXIF tags when exporting, helps keep EXIF size under ~64Kb
* OpenCL: properly discard CPU-based OpenCL devices. Fixes crashes on startup with some partially-working OpenCL implementations like pocl.
* darktable-cli: do not even try to open display, we don’t need it.
* Hotpixels module: make it actually work for X-Trans

## Some More Changes, Probably Not Complete:

* Drop darktable-viewer tool in favor of slideshow view
* Remove gnome keyring password backend, use libsecret instead
* When using libsecret to store passwords then put them into the correct collection
* Hint via window manager when import/export is done
* Quick tagging searches anywhere, not just at the start of tags
* The sidecar Xmp schema for history entries is now more consistent and less error prone
* Rawspeed: fixes for building with libjpeg (as opposed to libjpeg-turbo)
* Give the choice of equidistant and proportional feathering when using elliptical masks
* Add geolocation to watermark variables
* Fix some crashes with missing configured ICC profiles
* Support greyscale color profiles
* OSX: add trash support (thanks to Michael Kefeder for initial patch)
* Attach Xmp data to EXR files
* Several fixes for HighDPI displays
* Use Pango for text layout, thus supporting RTL languages
* Many bugs got fixed and some memory leaks plugged
* The usermanual was updated to reflect the changes in the 2.2 series

## Changed Dependencies:

* CMake 3.0 is now required.
* In order to compile darktable you now need at least gcc-4.7+/clang-3.3+, but better use gcc-5.0+
* Drop support for OS X 10.6
* Bump required libexiv2 version up to 0.24
* Bump GTK+ requirement to gtk-3.14. (because even Debian/stable has it)
* Bump GLib requirement to glib-2.40.
* Port to OpenJPEG2
* SDL is no longer needed.

A special note to all the darktable Fedora users: Fedora-provided darktable packages are intentionally built with Lua disabled. Thus, Lua scripting will not work. This breaks e.g. darktable-gimp integration. Please bug Fedora. In the mean time you could fix that by self-compiling darktable (pass `-DDONT_USE_INTERNAL_LUA=OFF` to cmake in order to enable use of bundled Lua5.2.4).
