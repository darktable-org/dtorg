we're proud to announce the third release candidate in the new feature release of darktable, 2.0~rc3.

the release notes and relevant downloads can be found attached to this git tag:

[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc3](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc3)

please only use our provided packages ("darktable-2.0.rc3.*" tar.xz and dmg) not the auto-created tarballs from github ("Source code", zip and tar.gz). the latter are just git snapshots and will not work! here are the direct links to tar.xz and dmg:

[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-2.0rc3/darktable-2.0.rc3.dmg](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-2.0rc3/darktable-2.0.rc3.dmg)

    darktable-2.0~rc3.dmg

packages for individual platforms and distros will follow shortly.

as we're closing in to the final version, we are also officially in string freeze as of now. this affects darktable, not the user manual.

the changes from rc2 include minor bugfixes, such as:

* camera support improvements

    * add support for the Canon PowerShot G5 X
    * basic support for Olympus SP320
    * Panasonic LF1 noise profile and white balance presets
    * noiseprofiles: add Sony A77mk2

* high-dpi fixes
* fixed a few memleaks
* 3:1 aspect ratio as preset in crop&rotate
* magic lantern-style deflicker has been activated in the exposure module
* updated translations

and the preliminary changelog as compared to the 1.6.x series can be found below.

when updating from the currently stable 1.6.x series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but it will not be possible to downgrade from 2.0 to 1.6.x any more. be careful if you need darktable for production work!

happy 2.0~rc3 everyone :)
