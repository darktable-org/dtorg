Dear all,

we updated both the English online user manual and the PDF version to darktable 1.4. The online version can be found at [https://darktable.org/usermanual/](/usermanual/), the PDF document is available from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.4/darktable-usermanual.pdf/download).

Many thanks to Ulrich and Jérémy for their outstanding work on keeping our documentation up to date!

Another thing worth mentioning is the current status of the user manual translation. We have several contributors working on translating the manual into French and Italian&nbsp;– thanks, Victor and Federico! We'll inform you once we have something to release.

Enjoy reading the new chapters about Lua, drawn masks and many other improvements.

Happy new year!

(and yes, we are aware of the fact that in some cultures new year might not have started yesterday ...)

/Simon
