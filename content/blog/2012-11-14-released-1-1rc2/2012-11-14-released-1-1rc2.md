i just uploaded the tarball for the second release candidate for 1.1:

packages for your favourite distros should be in the usual place, mac dmg is here:

i know there are still translations coming, but something has to be
left for the final release after all :)

changes since rc1 aren't many as to be expected, but we've got:



	
  * canon eos m support (new rawspeed, also includes samsung nx fix)

	
  * usermanual is progressing

	
  * two new translations (both portuguese.. ;) )

	
  * reworked the much hated `more plugins' widget (thanks to boucman)

	
  * a lot of bugfixes (mainly thanks to ulrich for his meticulous work)


enjoy!
