## darktable 1.4.2 Release Notes

* A lot of cleanup was done to allow larger images to be handled by darktable without crashing as often
* A significant effort has been made to cleanup some of our code, fixing a lot of minor memory leaks and some corner case bugs in the process
* A bunch of masks corner cases fixed
* Tonecurve no longer clamps the gamut
* Assorted TIFF reader/writer fixes
* Map view: only connect to the map server when active
* Use filesystem timestamp for images lacking EXIF
* Sync AMAZE code from RawTherapee, now with SSE2 optimization, so it's less slow
* Olympus: lens detection for some Olympus cameras should work better now (requires images to be re-imported)

* SONY ILCE-7(R) garbage pixels are now cut off
* Experimental support for Nikon D5300
* Experimental support for Nikon D3300
* Experimental support for Samsung NX1100
* Experimental support for Samsung NX30
* Very experimental support for Olympus E-M10 (color rendering is still subject to future change, and may retroactively affect your image library for this camera)
* New white balance presets for:

    * Nikon D610
    * Olympus E-PL5
    * Olympus E-PM2
