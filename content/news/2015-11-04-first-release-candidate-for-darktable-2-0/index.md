We're proud to announce the first release candidate in the new feature release of darktable, 2.0~rc1.

The release notes and relevant downloads can be found attached to this git tag:

[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc1)

Please only use our provided packages ("darktable-2.0.rc1.*" tar.xz and dmg) not the auto-created tarballs from GitHub ("Source code", zip and tar.gz). The latter are just git snapshots and will not work! Here are the direct links to tar.xz and dmg:

Packages for individual platforms and distros will follow shortly.

For your convenience, these are the ubuntu/debian packages required to build the source:

    $ sudo apt-get build-dep darktable && sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libpugixml-dev libcolord-gtk-dev libosmgpsmap-1.0-0-dev libcups2-dev

And the preliminary changelog can be found below.

When updating from the currently stable 1.6.x series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but it will not be possible to downgrade from 2.0 to 1.6.x any more. Be careful if you need darktable for production work!

Happy 2.0~rc1 everyone :)
