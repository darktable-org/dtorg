Yes, it's this time of the year again. The annual [Libre Graphics Meeting](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/) is getting closer, and we, that is the whole developer community of your favorite free graphics applications, would like to ask you for your help. Some of you might remember our call for sponsoring from last year. Back then we asked for donations for specific people&nbsp;â€“ a task that didn't work out that well in the end. So this year we would just like to ask you for a small donation to the general funding campaign instead. This money is only being used to pay the travel expenses of developers and contributors of free graphics projects. Like us. You can see an incomplete list [here](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/projects/).

If you want to make sure that good things can happen, like having the first-ever real life darktable developer meeting, please consider to spare a coin at the [official Pledgie campaign](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/22927). Thank you.

Of course you are also welcome to attend LGM yourself. Make sure to ping us beforehand so we can meet. :-)

**Update:** The [program](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/program/) is now online.
