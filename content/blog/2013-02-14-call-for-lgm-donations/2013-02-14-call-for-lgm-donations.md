Hello everyone,

today we have a request to you, the users of darktable.

As you might know there is an annual meeting of developers and users of free and open source graphics applications (like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org/), [blender](https://www.blender.org/), [scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), and also darktable), the [Libre Graphics Meeting](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013/). This year it's held in Madrid, Spain, and it's a great opportunity to discuss things with other developers face-to-face. Last year this has brought us native colord support in darktable.

Since traveling around the world can be quite expensive at times we need YOUR help. If you think that you can spare some coin please consider to donate to [this Pledgie campaign](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/18338). The current status is that every Cent will go to [tatica's travel fund](https://tatica.org/en/2013/01/22/lgm-recaudando-fondos-con-arte/).

In case you don't know who tatica is, she is doing the Spanish translation of darktable and promised to use her time at LGM to translate the usermanual, too. So we are aware that only Spanish speaking people will directly benefit from her going to LGM, but everyone else is welcome to show appreciation for her work, too. And maybe it will encourage others to follow her example and also translate the usermanual to your language next. :)

Thank you for reading

the darktable team

PS: If you happen to be in Madrid mid April some of us would love to meet you.
