It's our pleasure to announce that darktable-1.0.5 has been released. Find the tarball on sf.net:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.0/darktable-1.0.5.tar.gz/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.0/darktable-1.0.5.tar.gz/download)

The Ubuntu PPAs have been built already, you should get them with your next update automatically if you subscribed to Pascal's PPA.

This has a good chance of being the last one in a series of stable releases (with stuff backported from our latest and greatest). Thanks to Pascal for maintaining it! As such, it comes with a short list of maintenance things as change log:

* Update to RawSpeed r438
* Update to LibRaw 0.14.7
* White balance presets for Nikon Coolpix P7100 and Panasonic GF3
* White balance preset updates for Canon EOS 7D, Canon EOS 350D
* Standard Color Matrices for Canon EOS 650D, Canon EOS 5D Mark III, Canon EOS 1D X, Canon PowerShot G1 X, Canon PowerShot SX220, Nikon D3200, Nikon D4, Nikon D800, Olympus E-M5, Panasonic GF5, Sony SLT-A37/A57, Leica X1/X2, Sony DSC-RX100
* A few memory leaks were resolved
* A few generic bugs were resolved

We'd like to take the opportunity this time to thank some other projects we depend on, and their authors for being awesome:

* **RawSpeed**: Klaus Post
* **LibRaw**: Alex Tutubalin
* **UFraw**: (white balance presets), Niels Kristian Bech Jensen, Udi Fuchs
* **DCraw**: Dave Coffin
* **Adobe** (standard matrices)
* **Exiv2**: Andreas Hugel
* **Lensfun**: Andrew Zabolotny, Sebastian Kraft
