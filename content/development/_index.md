# Contributing

If you feel like contributing to this project, here are a few suggestions.

## Testing:

Just use it! And afterwards let us know how you like it. Send your _bug reports_, _feature requests_, _suggestions_ or just your personal opinion to our [mailing list](/contact/#how-to-get-in-contact). You can file a bug to our [bug tracker](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues) as well&nbsp;– but you want to discuss it first (on IRC or mailing list).

If you found a bug or managed to crash darktable, please submit a _helpful backtrace_! Instructions are below.

## Translating:

A short introduction can be found in our git repository,  [TRANSLATORS.md](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/master/doc/TRANSLATORS.md).

## Supplying a color matrix for your camera:

Color matrices are specifications on how camera-native color is transformed into something that an end user might like, and ideally will be correct when viewed on a calibrated display. Read more about this in [our docs](https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/development/en/special-topics/darktable-chart/).


## Coding

Write image operation _modules_! Submit _patches_! Help to track down bugs by supplying _backtraces_! See the [GitHub wiki for more details](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Getting-started).
