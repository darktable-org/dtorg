i just uploaded the tarball for the second release candidate for 1.1:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.1/darktable-1.1~rc2.tar.gz/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darktable/files/darktable/1.1/darktable-1.1~rc2.tar.gz/download)

packages for your favourite distros should be in the usual place, mac dmg is here:

i know there are still translations coming, but something has to be
left for the final release after all :)

changes since rc1 aren't many as to be expected, but we've got:

* canon eos m support (new rawspeed, also includes samsung nx fix)
* usermanual is progressing
* two new translations (both portuguese ... ;) )
* reworked the much hated `more plugins' widget (thanks to boucman)
* a lot of bugfixes (mainly thanks to ulrich for his meticulous work)

enjoy!
