finally a new release.. it has been so long that i hardly remember all the changes. let's try to list the most important ones:



	
  * libraw 0.10.0-beta3

	
  * tethered shooting mode

	
  * import from camera via gphoto2

	
  * new, improved modules: vignetting, velvia, grain, denoise (via bilateral filter), color transfer, channel mixer ..

	
  * crop/rotate: straighten tool, perspective correction, guide lines (ported from digikam)

	
  * lots of new input color matrices and base curves

	
  * openexr export

	
  * database format changed, which greatly improves speed (and cuts down used disk memory)

	
  * film strip view in darkroom mode for quick image switching

	
  * cool alternative demosaicing algorithms (ported from rawtherapee): dcb, amaze, vcd, c/a autocorrection

	
  * customizable preset system for all darkroom modules with auto application to matching images, selected by exif

	
  * reworked export system to modularly support export to picasa webalbum, email, or disk in jpg, png, 8/16-tiff, pfm, exr, or 16-ppm.

	
  * lots of performance enhancements (modules denoise and local contrast are still slow)

	
  * translations: de es fi fr gl nl ru sv


as always, the release comes with a warning: it will be outdated horribly in very short time (even now git master has some really cool new features over the release tarball..). thanks to all contributors, translators, and everyone on #darktable!
