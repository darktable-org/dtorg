we're proud to announce the second release candidate in the new feature release of darktable, 2.0~rc2.

as always, please don't use the autogenerated tarball provided by github, but only our tar.xz.

the release notes and relevant downloads can be found attached to this git tag:
[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc2](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-2.0rc2)
please only use our provided packages ("darktable-2.0.rc2.*" tar.xz and dmg) not the auto-created tarballs from github ("Source code", zip and tar.gz). the latter are just git snapshots and will not work! here are the direct links to tar.xz and dmg:
[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-2.0rc2/darktable-2.0.rc2.tar.xz](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-2.0rc2/darktable-2.0.rc2.tar.xz)

packages for individual platforms and distros will follow shortly.

for your convenience, robert hutton collected build instructions for quite a few distros in our wiki:

[https://redmine.darktable.org/projects/darktable/wiki/Building_darktable_20](https://redmine.darktable.org/projects/darktable/wiki/Building_darktable_20)

the changes from rc1 include many minor bugfixes, such as:

* high iso fix for exif data of some cameras
* various macintosh fixes (fullscreen)
* fixed a deadlock
* updated translations

and the preliminary changelog as compared to the 1.6.x series can be found below.

when updating from the currently stable 1.6.x series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but it will not be possible to downgrade from 2.0 to 1.6.x any more. be careful if you need darktable for production work!

happy 2.0~rc2 everyone :)
