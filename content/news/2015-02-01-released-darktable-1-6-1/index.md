We are happy to announce that darktable 1.6.1 has been released. Due to an oversight on our side we forgot to do this announcement back when the actual release was done, so this is mostly for historical reasons.

The release notes and relevant downloads can be found attached to this git tag:
[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-1.6.1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-1.6.1)
Please only use our provided packages (green buttons tar.xz and dmg) not the auto-created tarballs from github (grey buttons, zip and tar.gz). The latter are just git snapshots and will not work! Here's the direct link to tar.xz:
[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-1.6.1/darktable-1.6.1.tar.xz](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-1.6.1/darktable-1.6.1.tar.xz)
and the DMG:
[https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-1.6.1/darktable-1.6.1.dmg](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/download/release-1.6.1/darktable-1.6.1.dmg)

this is a point release which fixes a couple of minor issues in the recent feature release 1.6.0 (such as a crash with images greater than 134 megapixels).

happy holidays everyone :)
