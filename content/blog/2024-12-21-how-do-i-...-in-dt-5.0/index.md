Users new to darktable who have experience with other raw developers
may have trouble figuring out how to do various tasks as a result of
different names or workflows in darktable compared to their previous
software.  The following entries are a quick reference to help you
accomplish what you want to do.

## How do I...

{{< details title="**run darktable in 'simple' or 'beginner' mode**" >}}

The large number of processing modules and many different ways of
accomplishing the same goal often leaves first-time users feeling
overwhelmed.  You can manage this feeling by *not* trying to use every
single option right from the beginning, but focusing on a few key
controls and slowly learning the rest as you discover that you need
them.

The [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel/)
contains the most-used sliders and controls other than cropping, so a
suggested strategy to ease yourself into darktable is to limit
yourself to the QAP and the
[_crop_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/crop/)
module while editing until you feel comfortable with them, then
gradually explore other modules (many of which are quite specialized)
and additional controls from the modules on the QAP which are not
displayed in the panel.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**start editing an image**" >}}

darktable uses a database to manage your images, including allowing
you to select which images to view/edit based on any combination of
criteria such as directory, camera model, focal length, date taken,
and tags or star ratings you have applied.  This means that you need
to first tell darktable about the files it should manage by
[importing](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/overview/workflow/import-review/)
them so that they are added to the database.  Importing with "add to
library" does not make copies of your files, it only stores
information about them.

You can import images using the
[_import_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import/)
module after starting darktable or by specifying the image(s) on
darktable's command line.  Your file manager may have been set up to
call darktable with the filename on its commandline when clicking on a
RAW image file; if not, you can probably use an "open with" command to
give the filename to darktable.

Once you have some images in darktable's database, you can start
editing one by double-clicking on its thumbnail in
[_lighttable_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/lighttable/lighttable-view-layout/)
view, which will open it in _darkroom_ view, ready for editing.  If
darktable was called with a single filename on the command line, it
will open that image directly in the darkroom.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**remove all of the automatically-applied edits**" >}}

Most of the automatically-applied edits you see in the
[_darkroom_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/) view when opening an image are required
to display your raw file _at all_.  Other software applies equivalent
edits, but doesn't tell you about it.

Operations shown with a dot-inside-a-circle can not be turned off,
because without them there is no image (a raw file is just a pile of
sensor readings).

Others which show with the usual power-button icon can be turned off,
but are needed to have a _useful_ image display.  Automatic addition
of the _color calibration_ and _filmic rgb_ or _sigmoid_ modules can
be disabled by adjusting the auto-applied workflow defaults in the
[_processing_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/preferences-settings/processing/) tab of the
_global preferences_ dialog.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make images look like out-of-camera JPEGs**" >}}

By default, darktable displays your raw images with minimal processing -
just enough to get a displayable image (for unedited images, the
lighttable thumbnail can be the embedded preview JPEG generated by the
camera using the manufacturer's own algorithms).  Because the camera's
internal processing generally adds substantial contrast and saturation
along with a midtone brightening of typically about 1 EV, this makes
darktable's default processing look dark, flat, and drab in
comparison.

As of version 5.0, darktable ships with custom styles to make images
from most supported camera models look more like the camera
manufacturer's processing, by adding the brightening, contrast, and
saturation boost.  You can apply these manually or have them applied
automatically on import.

For automatic application, install and activate the
"apply_camera_style" Lua script in the [script
installer](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/lua-scripts-installer/).
You can also use this script to apply the appropriate style to a
selection of images which have already been imported.

For manual application, open the
[_styles_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles/)
module and navigate to the "darktable camera styles" entry in the list
of styles.  Expand this entry to show camera manufacturers, then
expand the appropriate manufacturer to access its models.  Note that
applying a different model's style to your camera's images is unlikely
to make them look like JPEGs from the other model, but may still yield
interesting results.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**pan/zoom the image**" >}}

In [_darkroom_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/) view,
you can zoom by

- scrolling while the mouse pointer is on the central image
  but not on any on-image controls or shapes (to zoom instead of
  adjusting a control/shape, hold down the 'a' key while scrolling)

- selecting a zoom factor from the pulldown menu at bottom right of the
  small navigation window which shows the portion of the full image
  displayed in the center view

- using keyboard shortcuts: Alt-1 to switch to 100% (200% if already
  at 100%), Alt-2 to switch to "fill" (fills center view, may crop off
  ends along one axis), or Alt-3 to switch to "fit" (shows entire
  image, may leave unused gray areas in center view).  You can adjust
  the zoom factor in steps of 1.1x with Ctrl-Minus and Ctrl-Plus
  (Ctrl-Shift-=) on the main portion of your keyboard (the keypad keys
  are not mapped by default).

You can pan a zoomed image by

- dragging the center image with the mouse (hold down the 'a' key to pan the image
rather than dragging on-image controls)

- dragging the highlighted box on the navigation thumbnail at the top
  of the left side panel

- using arrow keys (note: if a slider is currently selected, the arrow
  keys will adjust the slider rather than panning the image)

 {{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**navigate among images in darkroom view**" >}}

While editing an image in the darkroom, you can move to the next image
shown in the filmstrip at the bottom by pressing the space bar, or to
the previous image by pressing Backspace.  You can also navigate to an
arbitrary image by double-clicking its thumbnail in the filmstrip,
possibly after shifting the displayed images by scrolling while
hovering the mouse over the filmstrip.  (Prior to version 5.0, a
single click would change images, but that made selecting images for
copy&paste operations more difficult.)

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**undo edits or other changes**" >}}

Most actions done in [lightable view](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/lighttable/undo-redo/) can
be reversed with the standard Ctrl-Z shortcut key and reapplied with
Ctrl-Y.

In darkroom view, you can either use
[Ctrl-Z](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/undo-redo/) to undo actions one step
at a time, or you can click on an item in the
[_history stack_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/history-stack/)
module to reset the edit state to what it was when that item was added to
the stack.  You can freely jump between different positions in the
history as long as you do not change settings in any of the
[processing modules](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/).
Note that changing settings while displaying a history position other
than the topmost (last) one will **discard** any changes above that point
and add your change to the displayed edit.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**save my edit**" >}}

You never need to manually save the state of the edit you are making
to an image -- darktable automatically stores the sequence of module
changes you make to its database and to the image's sidecar file (same
name as the image but with an added extension *.xmp*).

However, these saved changes are merely the "recipe" which lets
darktable recreate your edit, so an edited photo is only viewable in
its edited state inside darktable until you create a new image with
the edits "baked in" by
[exporting](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/overview/workflow/export/)
the image.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**batch edit photos**" >}}

To apply the same edit to multiple photos, you can

- use a [style](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles/)

- edit one photo and then
  [copy and paste](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/history-stack/)
  the edits onto others.  In _darkroom_ view, you will need to use
  keyboard shortcuts to access _copy_ (Ctrl-C) or _selective copy_
  (Ctrl-Shift-C) and _paste_ (Ctrl-V) functions; in _lighttable_, they
  are also available in the _history stack_ module.

- in _darkroom_ view, use the Ctrl-X shortcut key to copy the settings
  of the module in which you last made changes to all selected images
  (new in 5.0)

See also the [tutorial](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/guides-tutorials/batch-editing/).

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make a virtual copy of an image**" >}}

darktable calls multiple developments of a single image "duplicates".  You
can create, remove, or name them using the
[_duplicate manager_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/duplicate-manager/)
in [_darkroom_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/darkroom-view-layout/) view, and you can
create duplicates by selecting one or more images in the
[_lighttable_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/lighttable/lighttable-view-layout/)
and clicking on the _duplicate_ button in the
[_actions on selection_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/selected-image/)
module.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make adjustment layers**" >}}

The darktable [pixelpipe](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/the-pixelpipe-and-module-order/) is effectively equivalent to a stack of
adjustment layers, and the right-hand active modules display can be
treated very much like a Layers window/pane in pixel editors.  You
start with a base image at the bottom, and then each successive module
takes its input from below, makes some modification (if enabled), and
passes the result to the module above it - just like in a Layers tool,
where making a particular layer invisible is just turning off its
effects.  As with adjustment layers, [reordering](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/module-order/) modules will
change the overall effect of the processing.

By enabling a module, or by [duplicating](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/processing-modules/multiple-instances/) one, you have just added
an adjustment layer to your processing.  Just like layers, (almost)
any processing module in darktable can be [masked](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/).

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**apply a preset**" >}}

What other programs call presets, darktable calls _styles_.

In darktable, a _preset_ is a particular configuration of a __single__
module, which may be accessed by clicking on the hamburger icon at the
right of the module's header.

A _style_ is a collection of presets for one or more modules which can
be applied to one or more images at once.  You can apply styles in
lighttable view with the
[_styles_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles/)
module, or in darkroom view by clicking on the styles quick access
button ![styles](styles-icon.png#icon) just below the bottom left corner of the image.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**adjust white balance**" >}}

In the default scene-referred workflows, white balance is adjusted
using the CAT (chromatic adaptation transform) tab in the
[_color calibration_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-calibration/)
module, which performs a perceptual white balance and
allows balancing multiple areas with differently-colored lighting
using masks and
[multiple instances](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/processing-modules/multiple-instances/).

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**adjust hue/saturation/lightness (HSL)**" >}}

To adjust the hue, saturation, and/or lightness of pixels based on
their original colors, use the
[_color equalizer_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-equalizer/)
module.

To adjust the hue, saturation, and/or lightness of pixels based on
their saturation or lightness, use the
[_color zones_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-zones/)
module.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**crop/straighten an image**" >}}

To straighten an image, right-click on your image and drag along a
line which _should_ be horizontal or vertical, then release the mouse
button.  darktable will then rotate your image to make the line along
which you dragged exactly horizontal or vertical.  You can also use
the _rotation_ slider in the
[_rotate and perspective_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/rotate-perspective/)
module, which is shown in the
[_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel/)
by default.

To rotate the image by multiples of 90 degrees, use the
[_orientation_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/orientation/)
module.

To crop an image, open the
[_crop_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/crop/)
module and drag the edges/corners of the crop box drawn on your image.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**adjust contrast/brightness/saturation**" >}}

To adjust contrast, you can use

- the contrast slider in either
  [_filmic rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/filmic-rgb/)'s
  _look_ tab or [_sigmoid_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/sigmoid/)
  (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel/)
  by default when workflow is set to either of the "scene-referred" options in preferences).

- the contrast slider in [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb/),
  adjusting the _contrast gray fulcrum_ slider on the _masks_ tab to control the center point of the contrast.

- the [_contrast equalizer_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer/)
  module for more localized contrast.

- the [_local contrast_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/local-contrast/)
  module for very localized contrast enhancement, also known as
  "clarity" (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel/)
  by default).

To adjust brightness, you can use

- the [_exposure_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/exposure/) module for linear adjustment

- the _brilliance grading_ sliders in
  [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb/)
  for perceptual brightness adjustments (the "global brilliance" slider is
  on the Quick Access Panel by default).

To adjust saturation, you can use

- the _global vibrance_, _chroma grading_, or _saturation grading_ sliders in
  [_color balance rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb/)
  (on the Quick Access Panel by default).

- the [_velvia_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/velvia/) module

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**adjust shadows/highlights**" >}}

To open shadows or improve details in highlights, use the
[_tone equalizer_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/tone-equalizer/).

On its _masking_ tab, click the two magic wands, and fine-tune the
mask brightness with the _mask exposure compensation_ and _mask
contrast compensation_ sliders.  Then move your mouse over areas of
the image you want to adjust and scroll to brighten or darken areas of
the image with that brightness.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make fine/exact adjustments to a control**" >}}

darktable has multiple ways to adjust a slider:

- click on a position on the slider to set it to the corresponding value

- scroll while on the slider; use Shift-Scroll for larger (usually
  10x) increments and Ctrl-Scroll for finer (usually 0.1x) increments

- use the arrow keys while the slider is selected; Shift-Arrow for
  larger increments and Ctrl-Arrow for smaller increments

- right-click for a popup; you can either enter an exact numeric value
  by typing it or adjust the value by sliding your mouse left or right
  to "wag the tail".  The higher up the mouse pointer is, the more
  quickly the values will be adjusted; for the finest adjustments,
  move the mouse pointer along the bottom edge.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make more extreme adjustments**" >}}

Most sliders in darktable have both soft and hard limits.  The soft
limit is the range displayed by default (e.g. -3 to +4 EV adjustment
in the _exposure_ module).  The hard limit is the maximum which
darktable actually supports, but which is usually too extreme and
results in insufficiently precise control using the slider (e.g. -18
to +18 EV adjustment for _exposure_, which is an amount only useful
for merged HDR sequences).  You can override the soft limits by

- holding Ctrl+Shift while dragging the slider or using arrow keys
- scrolling while in the left-most or right-most 10% of the slider
- right-clicking on the slider and typing in the desired value

In cases where there is no separate hard limit, or the hard limit is
_still_ too small, you can usually strengthen whichever effect is not
enough by adding a second (third, etc.)
[instance](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/processing-modules/multiple-instances/)
of the module.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**add clarity**" >}}

What other programs call clarity is an adjustment of local contrast.
You can do this in darktable

- with the
  [_local contrast_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/local-contrast/)
  module (on the
  [_Quick Access Panel_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel/)
  by default)

- by starting with the "clarity" preset in the
  [_contrast equalizer_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer/)
  module (quite strong)

- by starting with one of the "local contrast" presets in the
  [_diffuse and sharpen_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/diffuse/)
  module (generally very subtle).

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**apply Camera Calibration settings**" >}}

The [_rgb primaries_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/rgb-primaries/)
module gives you similar control over red/green/blue hue and
saturation and tinting of neutral colors.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make a luminosity mask**" >}}

Since a luminosity masks adjusts the strength of an effect by the
brightness of each pixel, you can accomplish this by creating a
[_parametric mask_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric/)
for the effect and adjusting the "g" (gray) or L/Jz
(luminance/lightness) channel controls.

- For a mask targeting highlights, move the upper left triangle all
  the way to the right;

- for a mask targeting shadows, move the upper right triangle all the
  way to the left.

- A midtone mask can be created by moving both upper triangles to the
  middle; to match other software, you may need to reduce the
  _opacity_ slider to around 50%.

The gray channel will provide a scene-linear ramp, while the L and Jz
channels produce a perceptually linear ramp.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**apply a split-toning effect**" >}}

Use the
[_color balance rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb/)
module and adjust the hue/chroma sliders for "shadows lift" and
"highlights gain" on the "4 ways" tab.

- The _hue_ and _chroma_ sliders for "shadows lift" control the color
  and intensity of the toning in dark areas of the image, while the
  sliders for "highlights gain" control the color and intensity of the
  toning in light areas.

- The "mask middle-gray fulcrum" together with the two "fall-off"
  sliders on the "masks" tab controls which luminance values are
  considered shadows and highlights.

There is also a legacy
[_split-toning_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/split-toning/)
module for use with monochrome images.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**add text to an image**" >}}

Use the [_watermark_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/watermark/)
module with one of the text markers, i.e. "simple-text",
"simple-text-shadow", or "fixed-size-text".

You can add multi-line text with a single instance of the module by
inserting "$(NL)" where the text should wrap to the next line.  Other
[variables](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/special-topics/variables/) can also be inserted and
will be replaced by their current values whenever the image is
processed.  The lede image for this post shows an example of multi-line text using the _watermark_ module.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**combine multiple images**" >}}

To combine multiple images, such as creating a mosaic or inserting
additional content into an image (e.g. replacing the sky):

- ensure that all images you want to combine have been
  [imported](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import/)
  into your library

- use [_canvas enlargement_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/enlarge-canvas/)
  on one image (the "base" image) to add more space for the other images, if needed

- use the
  [_composite_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite/)
  module and drag the second image from the filmstrip into the module.
  Adjust the position, size, and rotation as desired.  Use a mask to
  include only part of the overlaid image.

- if you want to combine more than two images, create additional
  instances of the _composite_ module, one per image

An [example style](example-4up-montage.dtstyle) (download and import into darktable from the
[styles](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles/) module)
shows the use of _canvas enlargement_ and _composite_ to make a 2x2
grid of images plus caption text suitable for printing borderless on
US Letter (8.5x11") paper.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**replace the sky in an image**" >}}

To replace the sky in an image, you will first need another picture of
just sky with the appearance you like.  Ensure that the image has been
[imported](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import/)
into your library.

On the image whose sky you want to replace, open the
[_composite_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite/)
module and drag your sky image from the filmstrip into the module.

Turn on [parametric](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric/)
or [drawn and parametric](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn-and-parametric/)
masking, then use color and lightness to select the sky and optionally
a drawn mask to exclude any areas which can't be excluded without
losing a portion of the sky.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make an image black&white/monochrome**" >}}

See the tutorial [_developing monochrome images_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/guides-tutorials/monochrome/).

You can use the [_color calibration_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-calibration/),
[_color balance rgb_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance-rgb/),
or [_monochrome_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/monochrome/)
modules to desaturate a color image to shades of gray.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**apply a radial gradient**" >}}

darktable does not have radial gradients, but you can get a very similar effect by
[_masking_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn/)
with a circle or ellipse which you adjust to a very small size with a
very large feather to get a gradual drop-off in intensity in all
directions from a central point.

It is also possible to curve a gradient mask, but this is more
appropriate for matching a curved line in the image than for emulating
a point source for an effect.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**select an object/person in my image**" >}}

darktable does not have AI-based object/subject selection, so you will
need to use a combination of
[drawn](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn/)
and
[parametric](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric/)
masks.  Start by drawing the rough outline of the desired object (you
do not need to be exact) using the "path"
![path](path-button.png#icon) tool.

Adjust the
"[feathering radius](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/refinement-controls/)"
slider to make the boundary of the selection follow edges in the image
and adjust the "mask opacity" and "mask contrast" sliders to sharpen
the feathered edges.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**remove an object from an image**" >}}

darktable does not provide any AI-based object removal or inpainting
methods, but you can replace an area in your image using either the
[_retouch_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/retouch/)
or [_composite_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/composite/)
modules.  With _retouch_, you can replace the area with content from
elsewhere in the same image using the "heal" or "clone" modes, while
_composite_ lets you insert an arbitrary image from your library.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**unsqueeze an anamorphic image**" >}}

Images taken with an anamorphic lens will have a different pixel
aspect ratio than the scene which was photographed.  To restore the
correct appearance, use the
[_scale pixels_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/processing-modules/scale-pixels/)
module.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**create a 'smart collection'**" >}}

Every [_collection_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/collections/)
in darktable is "smart", and will immediately update when an image's
metadata changes such that it is newly included in or excluded from
the collection's search criteria.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**make a before/after (A/B) comparison**" >}}

Use the
[_snapshots_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/snapshots/)
utility module, which will let you compare two different edit states
in an adjustable split view, even between different images.

In darkroom view, go to the first image/edit state you want to compare
and click on the "take snapshot" button in the _snapshots_ module.
Then go to the second image/edit state you want to compare and click
on the button for the snapshot you just took.  You can drag the
divider line to adjust the split and click on its midpoint to rotate
the split.  Click on the snapshot button again to turn off the
split-image view.

You can also make a duplicate (virtual copy) of the image and compare
the two completed edits on the copies side-by-side using
[culling mode](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/lighttable/lighttable-modes/culling/)
in the lighttable view.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="**show composition guides (e.g. rule of thirds)**" >}}

In [_darkroom_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/darkroom/darkroom-view-layout/)
view, click on the "guides" button ![guides](guides-button.png#icon)
at the bottom right of the central image or press "g" to toggle an

{{< details title="**print my images**" >}}

Use the
[_Print_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/lighttable/lighttable-modes/culling/)
view by clicking on the "other" pulldown at top right and selecting
"print".  Unfortunately, printing is not available for the Windows
version due to lack of the printer library used on Linux and MacOS.

{{< details title="**get a list of keyboard shortcuts**" >}}

Press _and hold_ the 'h' key.  The window which pops up will show a
listing of all keyboard shortcuts available in the current view,
including those you've defined yourself.  This window will disappear
when you release the key, unless you click on the icon at top right
while still holding down 'h'.

You can define your own keyboard shortcut by clicking on the keybaord
icon above the top right corner of the thumbnail grid (lighttable
view), center image (darkroom view), or map (map view), then pressing
a key combination while hovering your mouse pointer over a mappable
control (the pointer will change to a little keyboard).  To cancel
mapping mode, click on the keyboard icon a second time.

Keyboard shortcuts can combine mouse actions with keystrokes, e.g. you
can define a shortcut which consists of scrolling your mouse wheel
while holding down the 'e' key and map that action to adjusting
exposure (scrolling up will increase, scrolling down will decrease).

{{< details title="**get a histogram of the image**" >}}

As of version 5.0, darktable defaults to using the "waveform"
[_scope_](https://darktable.org/usermanual/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/scopes/),
which provides much more information about the distribution of colors
and tones in your image than the traditional histogram.  You can think
of it as making hundreds of individual histograms for vertical slices
of your image, and lining them all up side-by-side.

To switch from waveform to traditional histogram, hover your mouse
over the waveform and click on the fourth button from the left which
appears while hovering.
