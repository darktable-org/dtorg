we released version 0.7.1, a small bugfix release to fix up some nuisances in 0.7:



	
  * some more white balance presets

	
  * layout fixes for overlong profile names

	
  * styles now actually work

	
  * extensive documentation in form of [screencasts](http://blog.pcode.nl/2010/12/06/darktable-0-7-screencast-library/)


enjoy the release, but be aware that you'll be missing out on a lot of significant speed improvements and cool new features when using the release instead of git :)
