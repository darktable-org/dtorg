as a feature release, it comes with a lot of new goodies:



	
  * [profiled denoising:](http://www.darktable.org/2012/12/profiling-sensor-and-photon-noise/) adapt to the properties of your camera's sensor (72 cameras already profiled for you).

	
  * [lightroom import:](http://www.darktable.org/2013/02/importing-lightroom-development/) convert some basic edits from your lightroom collection to darktable operations.

	
  * [multi instance support:](http://www.darktable.org/2013/02/multi-instances/) duplicate your modules and apply them more than one time with different settings.

	
  * improved usability for distorting modules (streamline spot removal in the presence of crop/rotate for example).

	
  * selective copy/paste of image processing.

	
  * new more intuitive keystone correction tool.

	
  * jpeg2000 support.

	
  * graphics magick import (support virtually all input image formats).

	
  * much faster thumbnail loading (if you can live with crappy embedded thumbnails).

	
  * incredibly lengthy list of small bug fixes, performance enhancements, and usability improvements.

	
  * new camera support (decode and color matrices).

	
  * dithering against banding.

	
  * sharper thumbnails in lighttable mode.

	
  * new oauth2 based picasa uploader.

	
  * updated translations.

	
  * and a thoroughly overhauled user manual, proof read by natives (thanks heaps guys!).
